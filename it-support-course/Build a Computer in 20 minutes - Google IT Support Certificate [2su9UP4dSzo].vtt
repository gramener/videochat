00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240
Now that we've learned what the computer components are and how they work,

1
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.380
we're going to assemble our very own computer, a full-size desktop.

2
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.840
Computers are incredibly fundamental to the work of an IT support specialist.

3
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.480
They're used in pretty much every aspect of the job.

4
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.760
Aside from work, knowing how to build a computer might inspire you to try all kinds of cool stuff.

5
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.760
You could custom build a gaming rig to play the most advanced game at their highest settings,

6
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.200
Or, like me, make a home media server for all your photos and videos.

7
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.580
Knowing how to build a computer is a skill that can be useful in lots of interesting ways.

8
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.860
Before we get started, let's lay down some ground rules for this ground up build.

9
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.760
Sorry, I can't help myself.

10
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:53.720
We should think about electrostatic discharge and try to prevent unwanted static from harming our very expensive components.

11
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.040
Have you ever rubbed your socks on a carpet then accidentally zap someone?

12
00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.160
That's pretty harmless.

13
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.700
But if you do that to your new motherboard,

14
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.800
you could completely destroy it.

15
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.380
So how do we prevent static discharge?

16
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.520
We can go about this in two ways.

17
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.160
You can touch an electrical device that's plugged in,

18
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160
but not powered on.

19
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.760
FYI, you should do this every couple of minutes

20
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.000
when assembling a new computer.

21
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.620
Another option is to wear an anti-static wristband,

22
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.480
like the one I have here.

23
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.280
Let me get it.

24
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.000
You connect the end of the clip to a non-painted metal

25
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.360
service like your computer and then you strap it on to your hands and voila you're done

26
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.040
while we're on the subject of anti-static safety I want to call out that when you

27
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.080
buy computer parts they'll come in anti-static bags to prevent accidental static

28
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.640
electricity be sure to keep them inside the bags until you need to install them on

29
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.560
your computer now let's get making this computer we'll start by laying down the

30
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.980
foundation of our computer the mother-book

31
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.540
Remember, there are lots of different form factors for motherboards and you want to make

32
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.340
sure the one you purchase fits your computer case.

33
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.240
We purchased a full-size desktop case and have a full-sized ATX motherboard.

34
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.240
On the motherboard, there are lots of screw holes which coincide with the holes in the

35
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.900
desktop case too.

36
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.860
You want to match up the holes on the motherboard to the holes on the desktop.

37
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.180
If you figure out which holes to use screwing these standoffs, standoffs are used to raise

38
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.800
and attach your motherboard to the case.

39
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.280
In this instance, our case has built-in standoffs.

40
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.520
Let's start adding on components.

41
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.860
The

42
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:32.540
Let's start by adding our components in.

43
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.100
We'll start with the CPU, so let's take that out of our anti-static bag.

44
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.820
You'll be very careful with these because they're very expensive and you don't want to drop them.

45
00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.260
Once we've taken that out the bag, let's line up the CPU with a motherboard socket.

46
00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.300
Something to note is this marker right here.

47
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.620
This has to align with the CPU socket on the motherboard.

48
00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.060
Also, don't forget to make sure you get compatible CPUs that fit your motherboard.

49
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.600
We have an LGA CPU and the LGA compatible motherboard socket.

50
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.300
So let's go ahead and align the correct orientation of the CPU and secure it in place like

51
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.300
this.

52
00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:22.260
So like mentioned before, you want to make sure that the pointers on the CPU and the socket

53
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.260
are aligned.

54
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.500
The easy part is putting the CPU in.

55
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.200
The fun part is securing this.

56
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.800
Just note that when you secure the CPU in the socket,

57
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.800
you do need to use a bit of force so it's tightly secured in.

58
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.800
Perfect.

59
00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.300
So now the CPU is secured in the socket.

60
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.000
Now that our CPU is in place, we need to add our heat sink on top of it.

61
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.200
The heat sink is used to dissipate heat from our CPU.

62
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.460
I want to show you some cool things.

63
00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.980
This part right here, this is what our CPU relies on to stay cool.

64
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.100
It takes the heat from there and then uses this fan to blow it out.

65
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.980
Before we attach the heat sink, we need to apply an even amount of thermal paste.

66
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.380
Let me get that.

67
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.140
This is the thermal paste.

68
00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:32.212
Thermal paste is used to better connect our CPU and heat sink So the heat transfers from one to the other better To get started apply a dab of thermal paste and spread it evenly with a flat object

69
00:05:32.212 --> 00:05:35.572
Let's do that on our CPU right here.

70
00:05:35.572 --> 00:05:50.052
So first thing that you want to do is slowly apply a slab on the CPU like so.

71
00:05:50.072 --> 00:05:55.572
And then with a flat object, apply the thermal paste evenly throughout your CPU.

72
00:05:55.572 --> 00:06:08.472
So you go halfway right here, halfway right here, halfway right here, and then halfway right here.

73
00:06:08.472 --> 00:06:12.432
Just make sure that I spread evenly throughout the CPU.

74
00:06:12.432 --> 00:06:19.832
You may have to do this multiple times to get this correct.

75
00:06:20.072 --> 00:06:28.372
Okay, so once you have that in place, you're going to take your heat sink and then you're going to press it against the CPU.

76
00:06:29.372 --> 00:06:34.952
And something to note is these screws right here, they align with the CPU socket.

77
00:06:35.272 --> 00:06:38.132
So that could guide you while you put the heat sink on.

78
00:06:50.072 --> 00:06:56.072
Great.

79
00:06:56.072 --> 00:07:01.632
Once you have all four sockets aligned, go ahead and get your screwdriver and then tighten down

80
00:07:01.632 --> 00:07:04.972
the sockets.

81
00:07:04.972 --> 00:07:13.712
So one thing to do is to make sure that you screw opposite sides first so you know that

82
00:07:13.712 --> 00:07:16.012
the heat sink is attached securely.

83
00:07:20.072 --> 00:07:36.572
So one thing I like to do again is just to kind of go over my screws to make sure everything is tightened securely.

84
00:07:50.072 --> 00:07:53.012
Great.

85
00:07:53.012 --> 00:08:00.032
Now that our screws are tightly on and our heat sink is secured to the CPU, you have to

86
00:08:00.032 --> 00:08:02.572
plug the small legs to the motherboard.

87
00:08:02.572 --> 00:08:09.032
This is important because this is what controls the fan speed via the motherboard.

88
00:08:09.032 --> 00:08:11.732
Perfect.

89
00:08:11.732 --> 00:08:18.512
So now you've fully installed and connected your CPU to the motherboard.

90
00:08:18.512 --> 00:08:20.632
Next, let's install our RAM.

91
00:08:20.632 --> 00:08:23.452
Locate the dim slots on your motherboard.

92
00:08:23.452 --> 00:08:26.492
So these are the dim slots, like we discussed before.

93
00:08:26.492 --> 00:08:28.172
I have four slots available here,

94
00:08:28.172 --> 00:08:29.452
and I have four RAM sticks.

95
00:08:29.452 --> 00:08:30.512
Let me pick those up.

96
00:08:31.632 --> 00:08:33.272
There's my RAM sticks.

97
00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:36.752
And of course, they're in my anti-static bag.

98
00:08:40.672 --> 00:08:41.752
Let's take them out.

99
00:08:48.512 --> 00:08:55.512
So as mentioned before, this build, we're going to use DDR3 RAM.

100
00:08:55.512 --> 00:08:58.512
All right.

101
00:08:58.512 --> 00:09:05.512
One thing I like to do before I install my RAM is to make sure that I align these slots with my RAM slots.

102
00:09:05.512 --> 00:09:09.512
So that way I'm not going to be forcing those in when it's time to install.

103
00:09:09.512 --> 00:09:12.512
So if you see right here, your slots are right in the middle.

104
00:09:12.512 --> 00:09:17.512
So something I do is before I put it in, just visually make sure that you got this right,

105
00:09:17.512 --> 00:09:24.512
align the rest of your ramsticks to the same position like this. So I'm going to go like this,

106
00:09:24.512 --> 00:09:36.352
like this, and like this. That way, you're not going to be damaging your pins if you pick your

107
00:09:36.352 --> 00:09:45.352
ramsticks up and accidentally force it in. So now we've got that. We're going to put this in

108
00:09:45.352 --> 00:09:49.752
this slot right here.

109
00:09:49.752 --> 00:09:53.592
Line up the pins correctly and pushing the ram until you hear click.

110
00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:56.912
You know it's secure when both sides of the rams are locked in place.

111
00:09:56.912 --> 00:09:59.272
And there's something else you should know.

112
00:09:59.272 --> 00:10:02.732
Your slots right here are both black and white.

113
00:10:02.732 --> 00:10:05.032
We're going to stick to using the white slots.

114
00:10:05.032 --> 00:10:13.592
There's two.

115
00:10:15.352 --> 00:10:19.352
And we're also going to put this one right here.

116
00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:37.352
There you go.

117
00:10:37.352 --> 00:10:40.352
You've securely fastened your RAM inside your motherboard.

118
00:10:40.352 --> 00:10:43.352
Next, we have our hard drive.

119
00:10:43.352 --> 00:10:55.145
In this example we using an SSD SAT hard drive instead of a HDD We just need to use one SATA cable to connect it to our motherboard

120
00:10:55.145 --> 00:10:59.145
So first I'm going to go ahead and slot this in this cage.

121
00:10:59.145 --> 00:11:03.145
This is going to vary from case to case,

122
00:11:03.145 --> 00:11:05.145
but this one's going to be easy.

123
00:11:05.145 --> 00:11:08.145
All we have to do, we just slide it in like so.

124
00:11:08.145 --> 00:11:12.145
And normally you'll hear it click like that.

125
00:11:12.145 --> 00:11:15.145
Once that's in, we just need to use one SATA cable

126
00:11:15.145 --> 00:11:17.745
to connect our SSD to our motherboard.

127
00:11:17.745 --> 00:11:20.145
Let me go and get that.

128
00:11:21.145 --> 00:11:22.145
So here we go.

129
00:11:22.145 --> 00:11:23.145
Here's a static cable.

130
00:11:23.145 --> 00:11:27.145
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to connect this end to our SSD.

131
00:11:29.145 --> 00:11:32.145
I want to connect this end to our motherboard.

132
00:11:37.145 --> 00:11:40.145
There we go. It's in.

133
00:11:42.145 --> 00:11:45.125
Remember, static cables can only go in

134
00:11:45.145 --> 00:11:52.145
one way. So now that we have our SST installed, let's go ahead and install our case fan.

135
00:11:52.145 --> 00:11:57.385
This is how this looks like. One thing to note is the small X. You're going to go ahead and

136
00:11:57.385 --> 00:12:04.685
find a label on your motherboard that says rear fans. Not all motherboards have this, but

137
00:12:04.685 --> 00:12:15.125
in this example we do have that. So just a note. Get those into the grooves. There you go. My fans

138
00:12:15.145 --> 00:12:23.985
installed and now I'm going to go ahead and attach this to the MoLax.

139
00:12:23.985 --> 00:12:24.945
There we go.

140
00:12:24.945 --> 00:12:28.665
Now my fan is attached to my motherboard.

141
00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:33.905
For best practice, you want to create a wind tunnel that takes in air, those it over your components

142
00:12:33.905 --> 00:12:36.385
and then pushes it all out back.

143
00:12:36.385 --> 00:12:39.925
Check out how our heat sink has a fan on it too.

144
00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:44.345
That's pretty normal since our CPU drains a lot of heat and we want to help cool it off

145
00:12:44.345 --> 00:12:46.385
as best as we can.

146
00:12:46.385 --> 00:12:47.605
We're almost done.

147
00:12:47.605 --> 00:12:49.405
Now we're going to connect our power

148
00:12:49.405 --> 00:12:51.425
and test to see if everything's working.

149
00:12:51.425 --> 00:12:54.665
So let's grab our power supply.

150
00:12:54.665 --> 00:12:55.505
Here we are.

151
00:12:58.865 --> 00:13:01.565
First, let's secure our power supply to our case.

152
00:13:01.565 --> 00:13:04.385
Be careful not to damage the motherboard when you install it.

153
00:13:05.585 --> 00:13:08.145
What you're going to do is you're going to put this in slowly like that.

154
00:13:11.065 --> 00:13:12.305
And then just slide it in.

155
00:13:12.305 --> 00:13:14.305
There you go.

156
00:13:14.305 --> 00:13:18.905
So one thing I like to do is I'd like to put my cables all the way up to the side.

157
00:13:18.905 --> 00:13:22.665
So like I mentioned before, it's not going to go ahead and damage the motherboard.

158
00:13:22.665 --> 00:13:29.065
So now I'm going to go ahead and start securing my power supply.

159
00:13:29.065 --> 00:13:31.345
There's always fun getting it.

160
00:13:31.345 --> 00:13:33.545
There we go.

161
00:13:42.305 --> 00:13:44.345
I normally like to go ahead and start my fingers,

162
00:13:44.345 --> 00:13:46.685
so it's easier to get in.

163
00:13:46.685 --> 00:13:50.285
And then once I put all my screws in,

164
00:13:50.285 --> 00:13:53.445
I'm going to go ahead and use my screwdriver.

165
00:13:53.445 --> 00:13:55.565
Fasten it.

166
00:13:55.565 --> 00:13:56.865
Tighten that.

167
00:13:56.865 --> 00:13:58.985
There you go.

168
00:13:58.985 --> 00:14:11.185
There you go.

169
00:14:11.185 --> 00:14:16.185
So let's go ahead and tighten our screws right here.

170
00:14:24.185 --> 00:14:25.185
Great.

171
00:14:25.185 --> 00:14:28.185
So now we've secured our power supply to the case.

172
00:14:28.185 --> 00:14:30.185
So it's not going to move anywhere.

173
00:14:30.185 --> 00:14:35.185
And just another note, you can also install the power supply before adding it to the motherboard,

174
00:14:35.185 --> 00:14:38.185
depending on how your case is laid out.

175
00:14:38.185 --> 00:14:40.185
Let's go back to our mess of connectors.

176
00:14:40.185 --> 00:14:47.185
There are a few things that I'd like to highlight.

177
00:14:47.185 --> 00:14:53.185
This big one right here, this is the one that powers our motherboard.

178
00:14:53.185 --> 00:14:58.185
Another one that we have, it's more of a legacy one, is this 4-pin molex.

179
00:14:58.185 --> 00:15:01.185
These connectors were used heavily before SATA came out.

180
00:15:01.185 --> 00:15:09.185
Now we use these connectors to power the majority of the SATA devices today.

181
00:15:09.185 --> 00:15:13.825
Most modern machines today will probably use SATA power connectors for your hard drives,

182
00:15:13.825 --> 00:15:16.865
so it may come with MOLEX to SATA adapters.

183
00:15:16.865 --> 00:15:18.785
Now, it's time for the fun part.

184
00:15:18.785 --> 00:15:23.105
First, let's go ahead and connect our power supply to our motherboard.

185
00:15:23.105 --> 00:15:26.385
So that's this big pin, as we discussed earlier.

186
00:15:26.385 --> 00:15:29.905
I'm just going to go in right here.

187
00:15:29.905 --> 00:15:33.745
And plug that in like so.

188
00:15:37.745 --> 00:15:39.105
Next, we're going to go

189
00:15:39.185 --> 00:15:44.185
go ahead and power the CPU with this 8 pin molux right here.

190
00:15:44.185 --> 00:15:49.185
It's going to be pretty tight, but you should be able to get it in.

191
00:15:53.185 --> 00:15:59.185
There you go.

192
00:15:59.185 --> 00:16:02.185
So what we just did was we have the power supply,

193
00:16:02.185 --> 00:16:05.185
is powering the motherboard and the CPU.

194
00:16:05.185 --> 00:16:09.185
So now that we've hooked up the cable to our CPU and motherboard,

195
00:16:09.185 --> 00:16:24.777
Next thing that we need to hook up are these cables that are sitting in our case This is going to vary from case to case but let go through it Some of these cables are used for your case buttons and lights So for this one I going to plug these in

196
00:16:40.217 --> 00:16:59.217
Okay, so our case cables are now secured to our motherboard.

197
00:16:59.217 --> 00:17:03.217
One good idea is sometimes your motherboard will come with some guides.

198
00:17:03.217 --> 00:17:09.217
This will help you fasten your cables to your motherboard so it's clean and tight on your case.

199
00:17:09.217 --> 00:17:12.217
So I'm just going to go and do that right here.

200
00:17:16.217 --> 00:17:19.217
Now that we have our cables securely fastened to our case,

201
00:17:19.217 --> 00:17:23.217
let's not forget one more thing, our graphics card.

202
00:17:23.217 --> 00:17:26.217
We'll need that so we can output video to our monitor.

203
00:17:26.217 --> 00:17:31.217
We're going to plug this graphics card into our PCI Express slot on our motherboard.

204
00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:37.217
Just like the RAM, you are going to put a little bit of pressure when you insert this in,

205
00:17:37.217 --> 00:17:42.217
Don't feel bad by putting a little bit of pressure and you'll hear a click like this.

206
00:17:46.517 --> 00:17:49.517
You should have done it. You're going to tightly secure it to your case.

207
00:17:49.517 --> 00:17:51.217
This is going to vary from case to case.

208
00:17:55.217 --> 00:17:57.617
There you go. Your graphics card has been installed.

209
00:17:57.617 --> 00:18:01.217
All right, I think that's it. Let's cover up our computer.

210
00:18:03.217 --> 00:18:06.617
First, make sure you take your anti-static bracelet away.

211
00:18:07.217 --> 00:18:12.217
Get our case.

212
00:18:12.217 --> 00:18:17.217
Put that in like so.

213
00:18:17.217 --> 00:18:20.217
And just tug.

214
00:18:20.217 --> 00:18:22.217
That's it.

215
00:18:22.217 --> 00:18:29.217
There you go. We finally built our machine.

216
00:18:29.217 --> 00:18:35.217
Last but not least, let's connect our monitor, keyboard, mouse to the desktop.

217
00:18:35.217 --> 00:18:36.217
So first, let's get our keyboard, and mouse to the desktop.

218
00:18:36.217 --> 00:18:37.417
Let's get our keyboard.

219
00:18:37.417 --> 00:18:41.217
What we're going to do is we're going to connect this USB to the USB port on our desktop.

220
00:18:44.617 --> 00:18:47.017
Then we want to get our mouse, do the same thing.

221
00:18:47.017 --> 00:18:49.017
Connect this to our USB port.

222
00:18:53.617 --> 00:18:56.817
And then finally, we're going to go ahead and connect our monitor.

223
00:18:56.817 --> 00:19:00.417
For this monitor, we're going to go ahead and use a display port cable.

224
00:19:00.417 --> 00:19:05.817
I want to connect one end to our desktop like so.

225
00:19:05.817 --> 00:19:09.977
Next, I'm going to plug this into my monitor.

226
00:19:09.977 --> 00:19:22.057
All right, this is the most interesting part.

227
00:19:22.057 --> 00:19:24.577
Let's see if all this works.

228
00:19:24.577 --> 00:19:27.697
So I'm going to power it on.

229
00:19:27.697 --> 00:19:31.777
I got a blue light, which is good.

230
00:19:31.777 --> 00:19:34.217
Of course, it's going to vary from system to system.

231
00:19:34.217 --> 00:19:36.217
Let's see if something shows up on the monitor.

232
00:19:38.017 --> 00:19:39.217
So, the computer's booting up.

233
00:19:41.757 --> 00:19:42.717
Let's see.

234
00:19:42.717 --> 00:19:44.717
Okay, it looks like the monitor is receiving signal.

235
00:19:45.917 --> 00:19:46.317
She's good.

236
00:19:46.317 --> 00:19:47.317
Oh, there we have messages.

237
00:19:47.317 --> 00:19:49.237
Success, there we go.

238
00:19:49.237 --> 00:19:49.917
It's working.

239
00:19:49.917 --> 00:19:50.817
Perfect.

240
00:19:50.817 --> 00:19:53.817
If you're having issues with your computer not starting up,

241
00:19:53.817 --> 00:19:54.857
that's okay.

242
00:19:54.857 --> 00:19:56.877
Check that your power supply can supply

243
00:19:56.877 --> 00:19:58.477
the correct amount of wattage,

244
00:19:58.477 --> 00:20:01.017
or make sure your connectors are in the right place.

245
00:20:02.017 --> 00:20:03.397
Oh, what's this?

246
00:20:03.397 --> 00:20:05.137
None system disk or disk error.

247
00:20:05.137 --> 00:20:07.937
Replace and strike any key when ready.

248
00:20:07.937 --> 00:20:09.957
Looks like our disk doesn't have an operating system

249
00:20:09.957 --> 00:20:10.997
to boot into.

250
00:20:10.997 --> 00:20:12.017
No worries.

251
00:20:12.017 --> 00:20:14.557
That's what we'll be discussing in the next set of lessons.

252
00:20:14.557 --> 00:20:16.337
We'll learn what an operating system is

253
00:20:16.337 --> 00:20:17.957
and what the main operating systems are

254
00:20:17.957 --> 00:20:19.497
and how to install one.

255
00:20:19.497 --> 00:20:20.577
Well, good job.

256
00:20:20.577 --> 00:20:22.257
You've got your computer up and running

257
00:20:22.257 --> 00:20:23.957
and it monitors receiving signal.

258
00:20:23.957 --> 00:20:25.577
So that's it.

259
00:20:25.577 --> 00:20:28.137
Let's take a moment and think about what you just did.

260
00:20:28.137 --> 00:20:31.657
Not only did you learn about each component of a computer,

261
00:20:31.657 --> 00:20:33.377
but you figured out how they work in the vision.

262
00:20:33.397 --> 00:20:35.397
and then we built one together.

263
00:20:35.397 --> 00:20:37.397
It's quite an accomplishment.

264
00:20:37.397 --> 00:20:39.397
For your next assignment, we built a widget

265
00:20:39.397 --> 00:20:41.397
that will let you assemble a computer digitally,

266
00:20:41.397 --> 00:20:43.397
putting all the different parts together.

267
00:20:43.397 --> 00:20:45.397
Or if you have all the computer parts already,

268
00:20:45.397 --> 00:20:47.397
you can assemble one in real life

269
00:20:47.397 --> 00:20:50.397
and then write a short review process of how you did it.

270
00:20:50.397 --> 00:20:51.397
If you get stuck, don't worry,

271
00:20:51.397 --> 00:20:53.397
go back and review the different videos

272
00:20:53.397 --> 00:20:55.397
covering the various components.

273
00:20:55.397 --> 00:20:56.397
I know you can do it.

274
00:20:56.397 --> 00:20:57.397
I've had lots of fun.

275
00:20:57.397 --> 00:20:59.397
It's teaching you all about hardware.

276
00:20:59.397 --> 00:21:00.397
And don't worry, we'll meet again soon

277
00:21:00.397 --> 00:21:02.397
when you make it to the system administration and IT info.

278
00:21:02.397 --> 00:21:05.277
and IT Infrastructure Services course.

279
00:21:05.277 --> 00:21:07.297
Next up, my good friend, Cindy Quatch,

280
00:21:07.297 --> 00:21:10.217
is going to introduce you to operating systems.

281
00:21:10.217 --> 00:21:12.757
Operating systems are absolutely essential in IT,

282
00:21:12.757 --> 00:21:14.717
considering that without them,

283
00:21:14.717 --> 00:21:16.437
none of this hardware we've discussed

284
00:21:16.437 --> 00:21:18.537
would be able to accomplish anything.

285
00:21:18.537 --> 00:21:19.837
Tell Cindy I said hi.

286
00:21:20.917 --> 00:21:22.957
