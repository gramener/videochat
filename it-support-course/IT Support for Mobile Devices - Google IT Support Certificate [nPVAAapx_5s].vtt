00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hi there, it's me again.

1
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
You might remember me from the previous module.

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And no worries if not.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
What's important is that I'm here now.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We've made some updates to this program to make sure you got the latest info on mobile devices.

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You'll see me again throughout the rest of this program, so keep your eyes peeled for me.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Let's talk about mobile devices.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Mobile devices are computers too.

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
They have CPUs, RAM, storage, power systems, and programs.

9
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.140
systems and peripherals. How are they different from a server, a desktop computer, or a laptop?

10
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.860
They're special because they're mobile. They're portable and usually powered by batteries.

11
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.380
Some mobile devices are general purpose computing devices like tablets or smartphones. Other

12
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.060
mobile devices are optimized to perform a specific set of tasks like fitness monitors,

13
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.940
ear readers, and smart watches. Mobile devices are usually very integrated.

14
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.440
Remember the systems that we showed you earlier?

15
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.760
The components could be taken out and held in your hand.

16
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.160
Mobile devices build some or all of these components together in a way that you can't take apart.

17
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.200
The smaller device, the more integrated the components usually are.

18
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.920
The CPU, RAM, and storage might be soldered directly to the device's motherboard.

19
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.360
Very small mobile devices use a system on a chip, or SOC.

20
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.980
A system on a chip packs the CPU, RAM,

21
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and sometimes even the storage onto a single chip.

22
00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.540
Not only are SOC small,

23
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.260
they use less battery power

24
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.340
than if those components were separated.

25
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.960
Even though they're small,

26
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.340
some mobile devices use peripherals.

27
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.280
Smartphones connect to Bluetooth headphones, for example.

28
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.280
Mobile devices can also be a peripheral.

29
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.040
A fitness tracker is a standalone device,

30
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.840
but it can also be a peripheral to your smartphone.

31
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.620
And that same fitness tracker might use a heart rate monitor

32
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.460
as a peripheral. It's peripherals all the way down. Mobile devices may use standard or proprietary

33
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.720
ports and connectors. You might need to have a specific adapter or connector for charging a device

34
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.580
or connecting your mobile device to a computer. Sometimes the physical shape or the intended use

35
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.740
of the mobile device makes a standard connection like USB a bad choice. For example, say you have a

36
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.600
waterproof fitness tracker. If it had a micro USB port, that port would be damaged if exposed to one.

37
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.620
So instead, it's designed with a custom charging interface that can be submerged underwater.

38
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:53.057
Here are some of the standard power data and display connector types you find used in mobile devices This is a USBC Next we have a lightning adapter then a mini USB and a micro USB a micro and a mini and

39
00:02:53.057 --> 00:02:57.257
this is a mini display port.

40
00:02:57.257 --> 00:03:02.477
Because mobile devices are generally small and have limited access to power, they run operating

41
00:03:02.477 --> 00:03:06.977
systems and application software that's specifically designed to maximize their performance.

42
00:03:06.997 --> 00:03:11.997
We'll dive into mobile operating systems and applications in future videos.

43
00:03:11.997 --> 00:03:17.997
As an IT support specialist, you might be responsible for helping end users with their mobile devices.

44
00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:23.997
This might include setup, troubleshooting, repairing, and replacing mobile devices.

45
00:03:23.997 --> 00:03:26.997
Don't worry, we're going to break all of this down for you.

46
00:03:26.997 --> 00:03:31.997
One super important thing, mobile devices can contain a lot of personal data.

47
00:03:31.997 --> 00:03:35.997
Some organizations allow people to use their own personal devices for work.

48
00:03:35.997 --> 00:03:42.317
for work. We call this Bring Your Own Device or B-Y-O-D. You should be careful to respect

49
00:03:42.317 --> 00:03:47.117
people's privacy when they bring their own devices to you for help. To know how to handle

50
00:03:47.117 --> 00:03:52.637
these devices is always best to refer to your organization's policy. Next up, we'll take a look

51
00:03:52.637 --> 00:03:56.517
at how to keep these mobile devices running without being plugged into a power outlet

52
00:03:56.517 --> 00:03:57.997
all the time.

53
00:04:01.997 --> 00:04:05.917
Sometimes, instead of being plugged into a power outlet all the time, we want to be plugged into a power outlet all the time, we want to be plugged

54
00:04:05.997 --> 00:04:11.197
to take our technology with us. Mobile technology uses rechargeable batteries to carry power

55
00:04:11.197 --> 00:04:16.397
with the device wherever we take it. Rechargeable devices might have an external charger for

56
00:04:16.397 --> 00:04:23.357
removable batteries or might have a cradle, stand, or wireless charger. So rechargeable devices

57
00:04:23.357 --> 00:04:29.277
might have an external charger for removable battery or might have a cradle, stand, or wireless

58
00:04:29.277 --> 00:04:34.557
charger. Look at this phone. We can top up the battery just by laying it on this wireless

59
00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:40.157
inductive charging pad. Isn't that cool? It's also a pretty clever technology. If you want to know

60
00:04:40.157 --> 00:04:45.997
how this works, check out the next reading. Rechargeable batteries have a limited lifespan, which is measured

61
00:04:45.997 --> 00:04:52.717
in charge cycles. A charge cycle is one full charge and discharge of a battery. When a battery is

62
00:04:52.717 --> 00:04:58.077
reaching the end of its lifespan, it may take longer to charge and might not hold as much charge as

63
00:04:58.077 --> 00:05:04.077
when it was new. For some devices, you compare the current cycle count of your battery with the rated

64
00:05:04.077 --> 00:05:08.317
cycle count of that battery type to see how much more life to expect out of it.

65
00:05:08.317 --> 00:05:11.917
You need an external power source to add power to a battery.

66
00:05:11.917 --> 00:05:16.797
This could come from a wall outlet, another battery, or even a solar panel.

67
00:05:16.797 --> 00:05:30.235
You also need a charging circuit that manages the power transfer from the external power source to the rechargeable battery This circuit works a lot like a power supply unit or PSU that we looked at earlier

68
00:05:30.235 --> 00:05:34.955
It makes sure the input power is converted to the correct output power.

69
00:05:34.955 --> 00:05:41.255
Instead of using a large PSU, rechargeable devices use more portable power adapters, power

70
00:05:41.255 --> 00:05:43.315
supplies, or chargers.

71
00:05:43.315 --> 00:05:47.755
A portable power supply powers the device while also charging the battery.

72
00:05:47.755 --> 00:05:53.514
These might sound obvious, but you need to make sure that you use the right charger for the right device.

73
00:05:53.514 --> 00:05:59.135
Mismatching chargers to devices can damage the battery, the device, and the charger.

74
00:05:59.135 --> 00:06:04.875
A lot of chargers and power supplies use USB connectors, but you'll see a wide variety of charging

75
00:06:04.875 --> 00:06:05.935
connectors.

76
00:06:05.935 --> 00:06:11.095
Rechargeable batteries can be damaged by very cold or very hot environments.

77
00:06:11.095 --> 00:06:16.875
Don't charge or discharge recharge recharge recharge batteries unless they're within their safe operating temperature range.

78
00:06:17.755 --> 00:06:21.354
It's not just that a damaged rechargeable battery might not perform well.

79
00:06:21.354 --> 00:06:23.435
It can also be very dangerous.

80
00:06:23.435 --> 00:06:27.435
Batteries can swell, rupture, and sometimes even catch fire.

81
00:06:27.435 --> 00:06:31.995
Before working with a damaged battery, you should know how to safely handle it.

82
00:06:31.995 --> 00:06:36.875
You'll find some supplemental readings after this video that explains how to safely handle

83
00:06:36.875 --> 00:06:41.755
lithium ion batteries, which is a very common type of rechargeable battery.

84
00:06:41.755 --> 00:06:47.595
Safe handling procedures vary based on the battery type, so be sure to read up on proper procedures,

85
00:06:47.595 --> 00:06:49.595
before you work with a damaged battery.

86
00:06:50.595 --> 00:06:52.595
When a battery reaches the end of its life,

87
00:06:52.595 --> 00:06:54.095
you'll need to replace it.

88
00:06:54.095 --> 00:06:56.095
Some devices will slow themselves down

89
00:06:56.095 --> 00:06:57.595
when the battery is getting old

90
00:06:57.595 --> 00:06:59.595
to make the battery last longer.

91
00:06:59.595 --> 00:07:02.095
If your device is running much slower than usual

92
00:07:02.095 --> 00:07:04.095
or shutting down unexpectedly,

93
00:07:04.095 --> 00:07:06.595
one thing to check is the battery life.

94
00:07:06.595 --> 00:07:08.595
Some devices have batteries

95
00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:11.095
that are designed to be replaced by the end user.

96
00:07:11.095 --> 00:07:13.595
Other devices have batteries that are very difficult

97
00:07:13.595 --> 00:07:16.595
to replace, like small laptops and mobile devices.

98
00:07:16.595 --> 00:07:22.595
As an IT support specialist, you might receive special training on how to replace batteries and devices that you support.

99
00:07:22.595 --> 00:07:30.095
Or you might be the person sending the device out for battery replacement and then returning the device to the end user.

100
00:07:30.095 --> 00:07:35.095
IT support specialists often have to troubleshoot battery life and device charging.

101
00:07:35.095 --> 00:07:41.095
The first step is to make sure the charger, the battery, and the device are all designed to work with each other.

102
00:07:41.095 --> 00:07:46.095
We'll talk about sending out devices for repair and troubleshooting skills in future videos, so stay here.

103
00:07:46.095 --> 00:07:47.635
so stay tuned.

104
00:07:47.635 --> 00:07:49.595
For iOS and Android,

105
00:07:49.595 --> 00:07:51.275
there are also some things that you could do

106
00:07:51.275 --> 00:07:53.775
to make the battery last as long as possible.

107
00:07:53.775 --> 00:07:56.675
It's a good idea for you to be familiar with these things

108
00:07:56.675 --> 00:07:58.914
so that you can help educate end users

109
00:07:58.914 --> 00:08:13.492
on the best ways to get the most out of their mobile devices Check out the supplemental readings to learn more Repairing a mobile device is different from repairing larger more generic computers

110
00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:19.492
First, there are thousands of types of mobile devices. There's nowhere we can cover all the differences.

111
00:08:19.492 --> 00:08:25.992
Instead, let's check out some of the tools and techniques that you'll rely on to keep mobile devices in your organization running.

112
00:08:25.992 --> 00:08:30.972
As an IT support specialist, you might receive training in this area and be responsive to

113
00:08:30.992 --> 00:08:33.992
for repairing devices that your organization owns.

114
00:08:33.992 --> 00:08:35.992
Before you attempt any repairs,

115
00:08:35.992 --> 00:08:38.992
make sure you're familiar with your organization's policy

116
00:08:38.992 --> 00:08:40.992
around mobile device repair.

117
00:08:40.992 --> 00:08:43.992
Depending on the device, you may or may not be able to repair it

118
00:08:43.992 --> 00:08:44.992
on your own.

119
00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:45.992
But not so fast.

120
00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:49.992
Keep in mind that even when you can repair a device on your own,

121
00:08:49.992 --> 00:08:51.992
it will usually void the warranty.

122
00:08:51.992 --> 00:08:54.992
So, check the impact on the warranty

123
00:08:54.992 --> 00:08:56.992
before working on a device.

124
00:08:56.992 --> 00:08:57.992
With specific training,

125
00:08:57.992 --> 00:09:00.972
you might be able to perform some repairs without

126
00:09:00.992 --> 00:09:03.092
violating the warranty of the device.

127
00:09:03.092 --> 00:09:06.132
For example, you might be allowed to replace a crack

128
00:09:06.132 --> 00:09:08.932
smartphone screen without voiding the warranty,

129
00:09:08.932 --> 00:09:10.812
but you're probably not permitted to replace

130
00:09:10.812 --> 00:09:12.212
a damaged charging port.

131
00:09:12.212 --> 00:09:14.752
If you're not allowed to perform your own repairs,

132
00:09:14.752 --> 00:09:16.812
then it may be your job to send the device out

133
00:09:16.812 --> 00:09:21.112
for repair or replacement with an outside vendor or manufacturer.

134
00:09:21.112 --> 00:09:23.192
You should know and understand the return,

135
00:09:23.192 --> 00:09:26.392
merchandise, authorization, or RMA process

136
00:09:26.392 --> 00:09:28.512
for each device that you deal with.

137
00:09:28.512 --> 00:09:30.972
The device is warranty or the service agreement,

138
00:09:30.992 --> 00:09:33.652
that your organization has with the device's manufacturer

139
00:09:33.652 --> 00:09:37.392
will determine how and when it will be repaired or replaced.

140
00:09:37.952 --> 00:09:40.552
Depending on the device and your organization's policies,

141
00:09:41.132 --> 00:09:43.712
you might also need to make sure that there's no proprietary

142
00:09:43.712 --> 00:09:47.112
or personal data on the device before it's sent off for repair

143
00:09:47.112 --> 00:09:49.772
by doing a factory reset on the device.

144
00:09:50.312 --> 00:09:55.112
A factory reset will remove all data, apps, and customizations from the device.

145
00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.012
We'll talk a lot more about factory resets

146
00:09:58.012 --> 00:10:00.592
and backing up end-user data in future videos.

147
00:10:00.992 --> 00:10:07.492
For now, just keep in mind that the end user should be told what will happen to their data when a device is sent off for service.

148
00:10:07.932 --> 00:10:13.152
When repairing a mobile device, follow the same best practices that we showed you for working on a PC.

149
00:10:13.492 --> 00:10:19.012
Protect against static discharge, use the right tools, keep parts organized and labeled.

150
00:10:19.372 --> 00:10:21.492
Taking pictures along the way can help a lot too.

151
00:10:22.172 --> 00:10:26.052
Follow vendor documentation and test the device to make sure it still works.

152
00:10:28.752 --> 00:10:30.972
