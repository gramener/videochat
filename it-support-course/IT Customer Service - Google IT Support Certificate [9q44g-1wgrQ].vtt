00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.540
Customer service is a critical skill in IT support.

1
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.780
I can't emphasize that enough.

2
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.400
You can have all the technical knowledge in the world, but if the user had a poor experience

3
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.240
in the process of getting their issues solved, you failed.

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.520
The techniques will discuss in these videos won't only help you with your users, the help

5
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.580
you work better with your peers, your managers, and maybe even your own personal relationships.

6
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.880
Keep in mind, these techniques don't work in all situations.

7
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.960
The reality is that no matter how great you are at customer service, some situations don't

8
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.860
have a good resolution.

9
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.760
Plus, everyone is different, so you'll need to tweak your style when working with users.

10
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.780
But the techniques will cover are intended to make your IT interactions more successful.

11
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.800
In IT support, you work with users to fix technology and improve how people use it.

12
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.560
To accomplish this, you need to develop a trust between you and the user.

13
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.580
Lots of employers believe that good customer service also builds brown loyalty, which is a key to success.

14
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.580
These lessons are meant to give you the foundational skills and techniques of how to deliver great customer service.

15
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.580
Customer service practices can differ from company to company.

16
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.580
So while we'll cover the key concepts of customer service in any IT support role,

17
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.580
it's important to talk with your employer to understand the company's customer service approach.

18
00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.560
This will also give you an idea of how much freedom or restrictions you will also give you an idea of how much freedom or restrictions you

19
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.980
you might have in the role.

20
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.120
Spoiler alert, great customer service requires

21
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.500
exhibiting empathy, being conscious of your tone,

22
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.600
acknowledging the person you're talking to,

23
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.780
and developing trust with the user.

24
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.480
If you remember nothing else from this lesson,

25
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.620
remember those four things.

26
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.080
The most important of all of these is empathy.

27
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.920
What's the difference between sympathy and empathy?

28
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.540
People will say things like,

29
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.080
sympathy is saying you're sorry, empathy is feeling sorry.

30
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.760
That doesn't really explain it.

31
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.320
So let's use an example to drive this home.

32
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.180
If someone fell into a dark, damp, dirty hole,

33
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.520
and you leaned over with a sad expression and said,

34
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.759
that must be a really tough situation.

35
00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.460
Then you're expressing sympathy.

36
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.840
You're sharing their feelings,

37
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.720
but you aren't experiencing those feelings.

38
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.180
If you crawled down into that dark, damp, dirty hole

39
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.800
with the person who fell and said,

40
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.680
this is a really tough situation.

41
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.540
Then you're expressing empathy.

42
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.260
you're able to see something from someone else's perspective

43
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.320
and understand their feelings.

44
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.280
The word choice between the two situations

45
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.360
is very similar, but the action.

46
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.900
The action you take by looking at it from their perspective

47
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.340
is what empathy is all about.

48
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.360
Some days it's hard to empathize.

49
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.140
I know from experience.

50
00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.840
Maybe you've had an argument with a loved one before work.

51
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.020
Then by the end of the day,

52
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.600
you find yourself getting annoyed or upset with users.

53
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.520
That's the moment when empathy becomes the more

54
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.100
most important because anyone can showcase empathy when it's easy, but someone who persistently

55
00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:11.380
displays empathy will stand out as a kinder human and a more professional and effective employee.

56
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:17.140
Once you have empathy down, you should think of your tone. Tone is historically thought of as

57
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.980
how you speak out loud. In this technological age, when many of our interactions are over text,

58
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.380
and IT support is increasingly done remotely, tone isn't just about how you speak out loud.

59
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.500
how you come off during an in-person conversation.

60
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.740
It's expanded into how you write, punctuate, and even spell.

61
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.420
If your tone is short or blunt,

62
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.300
then the user will feel brushed off and devalued.

63
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.780
But if your tone is friendly and curious,

64
00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.560
the user is much more likely to have a positive experience

65
00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.880
working with you.

66
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.580
Be careful not to go overboard with the friendliness, though.

67
00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.580
It could be disingenuous.

68
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.980
Communicating a good tone is a delicate balance.

69
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.360
How you ask a question and how you respond to

70
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.380
a user's question matters.

71
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.820
Let's say you tell a user in an email,

72
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.820
turn your computer off and on again,

73
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.460
and it will start working.

74
00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.220
They'll probably never respond,

75
00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.720
and your company may have lost a customer

76
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.540
because the tone is just too short and pretty unfriendly.

77
00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.800
Well, it gets to the point,

78
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.260
it doesn't leave the door open to a conversation.

79
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.899
What if instead you wrote,

80
00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:23.000
please try turning your computer off and back on again?

81
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.840
This should update the change we made and fix the problem.

82
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.280
If that doesn't work, just let me.

83
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.880
me know. It's a little wordier, but it has a better tone of asking versus telling, inviting

84
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:38.060
them back to connect with you in case the issue isn't resolved leaves the lines of communication

85
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.320
open. Tone can be especially difficult when you're supporting someone in a different region

86
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.900
or country. Make sure to familiarize yourself with a local style, whether that's more conversational

87
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.040
or direct, and adjust yourself depending on the audience. In this day and age of text and email,

88
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:57.360
it's easy to ignore what someone says. If a comment seems to be a comment seems to be able to be.

89
00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.380
like a dig or it's just too much information provided,

90
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.380
we tend to shy away from responding.

91
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.380
It's also really common to forget to tell the user

92
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.380
what you're doing while you're troubleshooting.

93
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.380
That might leave the user waiting in an awkward silence.

94
00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.380
Whenever possible, acknowledge the user.

95
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.380
This reduces the tension that might build

96
00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.380
and helps you understand how you're working toward a solution.

97
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.380
Let's say you're chatting back and forth with the user.

98
00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.380
You're asking a lot of questions to better troubleshoot the issue.

99
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.380
The user is answering them, but also,

100
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.140
them but also makes comments like, geez, I already answered these in my last email, or I

101
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.440
just want to know what's causing my problem.

102
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.120
You choose to ignore this and continue on with your troubleshooting.

103
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.140
You think you're close to solving the problem, and these side comments are just a distraction.

104
00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.000
But then the user stops fully engaging with you and only gives you half answers to your questions.

105
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.060
Now you're not able to solve the issue at all.

106
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.760
The user's unhappy, you're unhappy, and the company's unhappy.

107
00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.260
It's a bad situation.

108
00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.900
Instead of ignoring the user in that situation,

109
00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.060
you could have said, I'm sorry for asking these questions.

110
00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.140
Sometimes repeating them will help new information pop up.

111
00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.140
Or you could have said, sorry for the repeat questions.

112
00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.440
I don't want to give you a superficial cause

113
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.100
when we could fix the root issue,

114
00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.040
and you won't have to chat with us again.

115
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.620
This helps them to understand your method

116
00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.640
and become part of the solution.

117
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.940
It's important to acknowledge your own actions

118
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.220
if you think they might otherwise confuse the user.

119
00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.240
Let's say a user contacts you to fix something.

120
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.260
After collecting some information, you go radio silent.

121
00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:40.885
What the user to do Would they ask if you still there Would they wait awkwardly until you came back on the line How long would they wait before ending the call or saying something How would they feel about their interaction with you

122
00:06:41.285 --> 00:06:41.985
Pretty awkward.

123
00:06:42.505 --> 00:06:45.665
But what if you said, I need to do some research on this issue.

124
00:06:46.125 --> 00:06:48.805
Would you mind waiting about five minutes or less while I do that?

125
00:06:49.245 --> 00:06:52.345
They'd probably say short and keep themselves occupied while they wait.

126
00:06:52.905 --> 00:06:55.905
They'd also feel more confident in your ability to resolve the issue.

127
00:06:55.905 --> 00:06:59.425
This leads to the most important thing to remember when working with people,

128
00:06:59.425 --> 00:07:01.745
And that's developing trust.

129
00:07:02.285 --> 00:07:04.665
This is easy to do if you have repeat users.

130
00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:06.445
They see you every workday.

131
00:07:06.965 --> 00:07:11.185
One bad day isn't going to stop them from trusting that you know what you're doing.

132
00:07:11.625 --> 00:07:16.745
But in a transactional user base where the user only contacts the company once or twice,

133
00:07:17.185 --> 00:07:22.405
how you interact with each user each time is going to break or build that trust.

134
00:07:23.044 --> 00:07:24.505
Why is trust so important?

135
00:07:25.025 --> 00:07:27.345
Without it, the user could be difficult to work with

136
00:07:27.345 --> 00:07:29.845
and could even ignore your advice completely.

137
00:07:29.845 --> 00:07:33.645
Empathy and acknowledgement are a big part of building trust.

138
00:07:33.645 --> 00:07:36.645
Without these, you'll find it difficult to connect with the user.

139
00:07:36.645 --> 00:07:39.345
By seeing things from the user's perspective,

140
00:07:39.345 --> 00:07:43.345
you're more likely to find a solution that will help them specifically.

141
00:07:43.345 --> 00:07:45.845
This lets them know that you care,

142
00:07:45.845 --> 00:07:48.845
and they'll be more likely to be engaged in the interaction.

143
00:07:48.845 --> 00:07:52.845
It's also important to follow through on your commitments and promises.

144
00:07:52.845 --> 00:07:55.345
If you tell someone you're going to follow up in one hour,

145
00:07:55.345 --> 00:07:56.845
then be sure to make it happen.

146
00:07:56.845 --> 00:08:00.385
And if you don't, acknowledge the oversight and apologize.

147
00:08:01.125 --> 00:08:03.665
Be sure that any claims you make can be backed up.

148
00:08:04.145 --> 00:08:07.225
Don't make something up to a user because you think it'll help in the moment.

149
00:08:07.845 --> 00:08:11.465
Be honest with the user, even if you think they won't be happy about it.

150
00:08:11.725 --> 00:08:13.725
And never be afraid to admit when you're wrong.

151
00:08:14.245 --> 00:08:16.425
This might be the hardest thing to do with the user,

152
00:08:16.825 --> 00:08:19.745
but you'll find that your interactions are more successful this way.

153
00:08:20.145 --> 00:08:24.025
Being specific and empathetic with your apologies will give it more meaning.

154
00:08:24.785 --> 00:08:26.825
And remember, no one wakes up.

155
00:08:26.845 --> 00:08:30.445
in the morning thinking, I'm going to be a jerk today.

156
00:08:30.445 --> 00:08:34.525
While you shouldn't sacrifice your self-respect, do your best to give the user the benefit

157
00:08:34.525 --> 00:08:36.684
of the doubt whenever possible.

158
00:08:40.684 --> 00:08:44.445
Now that we've covered the main customer service techniques, we're going to dive into some

159
00:08:44.445 --> 00:08:50.845
of the nitty-gritty by looking at the anatomy of an interaction. These apply to any channel of IT

160
00:08:50.845 --> 00:08:56.685
support, email, phone, chat, or in-person interactions. From the first,

161
00:08:56.845 --> 00:09:02.345
moment you interact with someone, it's important to think about how you say hello.

162
00:09:02.345 --> 00:09:04.505
Do you make sure to tell them your name?

163
00:09:04.505 --> 00:09:07.845
Do you incorporate information you know about them in your greeting?

164
00:09:07.845 --> 00:09:09.725
Do you ensure a positive tone?

165
00:09:09.725 --> 00:09:12.025
Are your spelling and grammar on point?

166
00:09:12.025 --> 00:09:15.964
These are all ways to create a really good start to the interaction.

167
00:09:15.964 --> 00:09:18.084
Some of these things are hard to achieve though.

168
00:09:18.084 --> 00:09:21.845
I'm a horrible speller, especially when I'm in a hurry.

169
00:09:21.845 --> 00:09:25.885
But knowing some of these trouble spots ahead of time will let you find ways to address

170
00:09:25.885 --> 00:09:32.125
them before the interaction. For me, I know that when I'm in a hurry, I need to recheck my spelling

171
00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:38.425
before hitting send. Have you ever heard the phrase, first impressions last a lifetime? Well, that might

172
00:09:38.425 --> 00:09:44.285
be a bit of an exaggeration. It touches on some truth. How you first interact with someone will

173
00:09:44.285 --> 00:09:50.305
influence how the rest of the interaction plays out. I'm not saying you have to be over-the-top,

174
00:09:50.305 --> 00:09:55.765
gushy and nice. That might have the opposite effect. Just be professional. Acknowledge the user.

175
00:09:55.885 --> 00:09:57.885
and show them some respect.

176
00:09:57.885 --> 00:10:00.885
Taking the time to get the interaction off to a good start

177
00:10:00.885 --> 00:10:03.885
will make everything that comes after easier.

178
00:10:03.885 --> 00:10:06.885
Let's check out two scenarios to see how this plays out.

179
00:10:08.885 --> 00:10:10.885
Hi Gail, how are you doing?

180
00:10:10.885 --> 00:10:11.885
Not great.

181
00:10:11.885 --> 00:10:13.885
It's been a bad day trying to get my phone fixed.

182
00:10:13.885 --> 00:10:16.885
Oh, what's wrong with your phone?

183
00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:21.885
Hi Gail, how are you today?

184
00:10:21.885 --> 00:10:22.885
Not great.

185
00:10:22.885 --> 00:10:24.885
It's been a bad day trying to get my phone fixed.

186
00:10:24.885 --> 00:10:29.045
fixed. Oh, sorry to hear that. Let's see what we can do to turn that around.

187
00:10:30.805 --> 00:10:35.045
Just by acknowledging their feelings and demonstrate your desire to help them,

188
00:10:35.445 --> 00:10:40.005
you've started to build a relationship with the user. Of course, you have to keep up the good

189
00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:44.005
work throughout the interaction, but laying the groundwork is an important first step.

190
00:10:44.565 --> 00:10:48.645
And remember that while you might have a hundred issues in the ticket queue that need

191
00:10:48.645 --> 00:10:54.565
your attention, this is the only one that matters to the user. So show them it's your priority too.

192
00:10:54.885 --> 00:11:00.885
The next critical step in an interaction is how you respond to the user's questions.

193
00:11:00.885 --> 00:11:05.385
If they're taking the time to explain to you what happened, but you brush off their concerns

194
00:11:05.385 --> 00:11:09.425
by acting uninterested, things are going to go south fast.

195
00:11:09.425 --> 00:11:13.745
Remember to integrate the information you've been given into your conversation.

196
00:11:13.745 --> 00:11:18.925
This will show you're actively listening and can help them feel more connected to the interaction.

197
00:11:18.925 --> 00:11:22.425
Let's look at an example.

198
00:11:22.425 --> 00:11:25.925
Which one of these greetings do you think is the most effective?

199
00:11:25.925 --> 00:11:26.925
Greeting one.

200
00:11:26.925 --> 00:11:27.925
Hi, Rory.

201
00:11:27.925 --> 00:11:28.925
How are you today?

202
00:11:28.925 --> 00:11:30.665
What can I help you with?

203
00:11:30.665 --> 00:11:32.665
Or greeting number two.

204
00:11:32.665 --> 00:11:33.665
Hi, Rory.

205
00:11:33.665 --> 00:11:37.305
I hope you're having a good day despite your computer randomly turning off.

206
00:11:37.305 --> 00:11:40.445
Let's see what we can do to fix your issue.

207
00:11:40.445 --> 00:11:43.185
It's important to be transparent with the user.

208
00:11:43.185 --> 00:11:48.545
If they start asking you a bunch of questions while you're still troubleshooting, you can do two things.

209
00:11:48.545 --> 00:11:49.545
First option.

210
00:11:49.545 --> 00:11:52.365
You can ignore them because they're just talking out loud.

211
00:11:52.425 --> 00:11:55.425
You can pause and say something like,

212
00:11:55.425 --> 00:11:58.425
I'd be happy to answer all of your questions,

213
00:11:58.425 --> 00:12:00.425
but I want to look up this one first.

214
00:12:00.425 --> 00:12:02.425
I've written them all down, though, so I won't forget them.

215
00:12:02.425 --> 00:12:06.425
If you say that, make sure to write the questions down.

216
00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:10.425
To really build a rapport, try to remember a personal fact they've mentioned

217
00:12:10.425 --> 00:12:12.425
and bring it up later.

218
00:12:12.425 --> 00:12:14.425
Maybe they mention they love cats.

219
00:12:14.425 --> 00:12:16.425
Later, while you're waiting for something to load,

220
00:12:16.425 --> 00:12:19.425
ask them if they have any cats or what their cat's name is.

221
00:12:19.425 --> 00:12:22.425
This shouldn't be forced, so if you're not the type to engage,

222
00:12:22.425 --> 00:12:24.625
engage in small talk, skip it.

223
00:12:24.625 --> 00:12:26.464
Now you're getting to the point where you're ready to

224
00:12:26.464 --> 00:12:27.565
troubleshoot.

225
00:12:27.565 --> 00:12:30.265
Just make sure you clarify the person's issue before you

226
00:12:30.265 --> 00:12:31.704
start to troubleshoot.

227
00:12:31.704 --> 00:12:34.704
If you don't, you might find yourself going down a rabbit hole.

228
00:12:34.704 --> 00:12:38.565
Imagine that a user tells you their computer can't get online.

229
00:12:38.565 --> 00:12:41.704
So you look at the IP address, DNS configuration,

230
00:12:41.704 --> 00:12:44.425
and you start paying things with no luck.

231
00:12:44.425 --> 00:12:46.165
Everything seems fine.

232
00:12:46.165 --> 00:12:50.265
Then 20 minutes later, you find out their machine is online.

233
00:12:50.265 --> 00:12:52.245
They just can't access a particular page.

234
00:12:52.425 --> 00:12:57.665
Had you clarified this at the start, you would have saved yourself and the user 20 minutes.

235
00:12:57.665 --> 00:13:02.185
It seems simple to clarify the problem space, but it's often overlooked.

236
00:13:02.185 --> 00:13:04.185
Take this example.

237
00:13:04.185 --> 00:13:16.650
Thank you for calling This is Leon How can I help you Hi Leon My computer isn working That doesn sound fun What do you mean by the computer isn working It won

238
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:21.610
connect to the internet. Do you have the corporate password for the Wi-Fi? No, why do I need

239
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:26.330
that? In order to connect to the Wi-Fi in the building, you need to use the corporate password.

240
00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:35.350
Well, I'm not in the building. I'm at a cafe. That's odd. Your computer seems

241
00:13:35.370 --> 00:13:37.970
be different than what we normally use.

242
00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.970
Can I get your name so I can look up your configuration?

243
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:42.570
Ling, Chan.

244
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:46.470
Um, do you work at this company?

245
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:50.670
No, my friend gave me the number.

246
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:55.330
Problem solving is a super important aspect of an IT support interaction.

247
00:13:55.330 --> 00:14:00.370
Being an IT support specialist means that you could be asked about anything.

248
00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:05.270
Even though you aren't expected to know the answer off the top of your head, you should know where to start looking at.

249
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:10.530
to find it. People are coming to you because they have a problem they can't fix themselves.

250
00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:16.570
Sometimes they feel self-conscious about asking for help. So be aware of how you probe for information.

251
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:22.330
Pummeling the user with question after question will probably create frustration on both sides.

252
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:27.610
Make sure to set context and explain why you're asking the question. Saying something simple,

253
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:32.970
like, in order for me to figure out what's really going on, I need to ask you some question.

254
00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:34.850
make all the difference.

255
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.490
When you're in person, things are a lot easier

256
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.930
because you can see each other and read each other's expressions,

257
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.450
but you might find yourself too comfortable.

258
00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.830
Imagine you're asking for help with your phone.

259
00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.550
You wouldn't want the person helping you

260
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:50.170
to just take it out of your hands without asking.

261
00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:54.030
So make sure you tell the user what you're doing before you do it.

262
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:55.850
If you're supporting a user remotely

263
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.850
and need them to run some commands,

264
00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.910
don't forget to tell them why you need them

265
00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:01.310
to execute the commands.

266
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:02.950
There's no need to go into a ton of deep,

267
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:06.970
But without some context, you could strain the trust you've built.

268
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:11.970
Make sure that when you're asking these questions or asking the user to run a command,

269
00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.970
you're really listening to the response.

270
00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:18.970
Those little nuggets of information may help solve the issue.

271
00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:24.970
The last five minutes of the interaction will set the tone for how the user feels walking away from the interaction.

272
00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:27.970
So make sure to end on a positive note.

273
00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:30.970
You might have solved their issue, but if they don't feel it was resolved,

274
00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:32.970
or they're unsure of the next steps,

275
00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:36.970
then they're going to walk away feeling like it was a poor solution.

276
00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:39.970
So how do you make a good final impression?

277
00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:40.970
Simple.

278
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:41.970
Reiterate the resolution.

279
00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:43.970
State the next steps.

280
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:45.970
Then ask the user if they have any questions.

281
00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:09.450
If you've ever worked in customer service, then you've dealt with difficult situations.

282
00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:13.910
The way you handle them in the food industry and tech world are pretty similar.

283
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.570
But before we dive into that, we're going to take a step back and talk about the science

284
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:20.690
behind what's happening in these situations.

285
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:22.430
Let's say someone's yelling at you.

286
00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:27.290
Whether it's about an overcooked steak or broken computer, your reaction to either will

287
00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:29.130
probably be similar.

288
00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:33.810
Your palms might be sweating, your hands might shake, or your mouth goes dry.

289
00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:35.290
Tunnel vision might kick in.

290
00:16:35.290 --> 00:16:41.730
These are all normal physiological reactions that happen in response to a perceived threat.

291
00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:46.130
This is part of our biological makeup dating back to the time when people hunted for their

292
00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.330
food.

293
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.650
When you're being chased by a cougar, you needed your senses to be at a high alert in order

294
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.510
to keep yourself alive.

295
00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:57.450
Even though someone yelling at you isn't the same as a cougar attacking you, it can

296
00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.110
feel similar in the moment.

297
00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.970
Your brain is releasing a mix of chemicals and hormones

298
00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:05.130
to heighten your senses and keep you alert.

299
00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.650
Unfortunately, a side effect is that you may have trouble

300
00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:10.630
focusing on a specific task, not ideal.

301
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.569
It's in times like these that you might go on autopilot,

302
00:17:13.569 --> 00:17:17.790
where your body has a physical reaction and it's hard to focus.

303
00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:20.270
It's super important to recognize these moments

304
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:24.429
and put a plan in place to reboot yourself out of the situation.

305
00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:26.929
Sometimes I feel this way when I'm teaching a class

306
00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:28.530
and someone is ignoring me.

307
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.290
They just don't pay attention.

308
00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:33.210
I used to call them out on it, the fight response.

309
00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:34.730
But this never ended well.

310
00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:37.450
Sometimes they had a good reason for being on their phone.

311
00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.210
And calling them out never made them listen more.

312
00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:42.950
Now, when I feel myself in that situation,

313
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:45.210
I notice that my pulse increases.

314
00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:46.669
When I realize that's happening,

315
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:49.790
I make sure to look around and focus on people

316
00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:53.910
who are more engaged in the lesson and make eye contact with them.

317
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.690
Soon, I feel my pulse slow down.

318
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:58.510
Some of your experiences in IT,

319
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:04.890
support might trigger similar reactions. Once you've identified this reboot action, write it down.

320
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:09.450
Remember, your brain isn't always working well in the heat of the moment, so it helps to have

321
00:18:09.450 --> 00:18:15.270
something to remind you what to do. It could be anything from squeezing a stress ball to looking away,

322
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:22.630
to taking a deep breath. The first couple of times, it may not work, so give it time. When you have

323
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:28.450
a difficult situation, take a moment to think about what went wrong. How are you feeling? What was

324
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:33.890
reaction. Why did you raise your voice? After a while, it becomes second nature to catch

325
00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:39.730
yourself and de-escalate the situation. To really hold yourself accountable, tell a co-worker

326
00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:44.770
what you're trying to do. Give them a recap of the interaction and ask them for their feedback

327
00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:50.850
on the interaction. You might get some great tips. But here's the bad news. Things aren't over

328
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:56.770
once you get yourself back on track. That's when the hard work starts. Every situation is different,

329
00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:01.090
and you'll learn the best strategies from experience and peer feedback.

330
00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:04.850
To get you started, I'll run through some tried and true techniques.

331
00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:08.210
Keep in mind that it's fine if you don't get these right the first time.

332
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:13.810
It takes practice, reflection, and feedback to really nail it, so don't give up.

333
00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:20.050
The hardest and arguably the best technique is to identify where the interaction went wrong in the moment

334
00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:22.290
and redirect the conversation.

335
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:26.750
This is really tough because it means remaining calm enough to object

336
00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:30.770
look at the interaction and understand what could have caused it to escalate.

337
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:33.770
At first, try this once the interaction is over.

338
00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:42.555
I'm

339
00:20:10.555 --> 00:20:20.355
You start your chat with the user and it's really pleasant and problem solving is happening.

340
00:20:20.355 --> 00:20:22.475
Then suddenly the tone turns dark.

341
00:20:22.475 --> 00:20:23.515
What caused it?

342
00:20:23.515 --> 00:20:25.215
Where was the misstep?

343
00:20:25.215 --> 00:20:29.375
Looking back, you might notice that the user didn't understand the question about what happens

344
00:20:29.375 --> 00:20:31.575
when he tries to stink his phone.

345
00:20:31.575 --> 00:20:33.475
And the tech just kept repeating it.

346
00:20:33.475 --> 00:20:39.335
The user gets annoyed and then starts typing in all caps, a clear sign they're irritated.

347
00:20:39.335 --> 00:20:41.895
In this case, the cause seems obvious.

348
00:20:41.895 --> 00:20:45.955
If the user didn't understand the question, then they probably got frustrated when the same

349
00:20:45.955 --> 00:20:49.155
question was asked over and over.

350
00:20:49.155 --> 00:20:54.055
If the IT support specialist had noticed this, they could have reframed the question and broken

351
00:20:54.055 --> 00:20:55.895
it down further.

352
00:21:09.335 --> 00:21:31.335
Another cause of frustration in user support interactions is when people talk over each other.

353
00:21:31.335 --> 00:21:37.335
This usually happens over the phone since there's sometimes a delay, but it can happen in person too.

354
00:21:37.335 --> 00:21:43.075
Typically, it leads to people talking louder and sometimes ends up feeling like you're yelling at each other.

355
00:21:43.635 --> 00:21:46.815
You've probably been in a situation like this with your friends or family.

356
00:21:47.375 --> 00:21:50.655
Everyone wants to talk and the person with the loudest voice wins.

357
00:21:53.575 --> 00:21:54.895
How can I help you today?

358
00:21:55.135 --> 00:21:56.355
My laptop isn't working.

359
00:21:56.595 --> 00:21:57.415
I need a new one.

360
00:21:57.475 --> 00:21:58.615
I have meetings I need to go too.

361
00:21:59.315 --> 00:22:02.835
I can certainly look into this and see what we can do to fix it.

362
00:22:03.215 --> 00:22:07.315
But I want to set context that our policy is to only replace,

363
00:22:07.335 --> 00:22:10.095
laptops if all other options have been exhausted.

364
00:22:10.095 --> 00:22:12.835
I don't need you to go snooping around my computer.

365
00:22:12.835 --> 00:22:14.155
Just give me a new one.

366
00:22:14.155 --> 00:22:16.415
Gail, I'd love to do that for you, but-

367
00:22:16.415 --> 00:22:17.615
That's ridiculous.

368
00:22:17.615 --> 00:22:18.635
I'm a director.

369
00:22:18.635 --> 00:22:19.575
I should get a new one.

370
00:22:19.575 --> 00:22:20.995
I don't have time for this.

371
00:22:20.995 --> 00:22:24.015
I completely understand the urgency of the situation.

372
00:22:24.015 --> 00:22:25.215
Why don't you let me take a look at-

373
00:22:25.215 --> 00:22:26.455
That's why I came.

374
00:22:26.455 --> 00:22:27.735
You need to fix it.

375
00:22:28.935 --> 00:22:32.655
It's important to try and identify why this is happening,

376
00:22:32.655 --> 00:22:34.475
so you can course crafts.

377
00:22:34.475 --> 00:22:37.315
In this case, you can simply stop talking.

378
00:22:37.335 --> 00:22:39.335
to calm things down.

379
00:22:39.335 --> 00:22:41.335
Then pause for about five or ten seconds

380
00:22:41.335 --> 00:22:44.335
to make sure they're done talking and start again.

381
00:22:44.335 --> 00:22:47.335
This might take a few tries before the user realizes

382
00:22:47.335 --> 00:22:49.335
what they're doing and gives you time to talk.

383
00:22:49.335 --> 00:22:52.335
Use that time to calm down

384
00:22:52.335 --> 00:22:55.335
and really listen to what the user is saying.

385
00:22:55.335 --> 00:22:58.335
Ask yourself, why are they talking over me?

386
00:22:58.335 --> 00:22:59.335
What am I missing?

387
00:22:59.335 --> 00:23:01.335
Then in those five to ten seconds,

388
00:23:01.335 --> 00:23:05.335
collect yourself and think about what you want to say.

389
00:23:08.175 --> 00:23:09.575
How can I help you today?

390
00:23:09.575 --> 00:23:10.975
My laptop isn't working.

391
00:23:10.975 --> 00:23:12.895
I need a new one.

392
00:23:12.895 --> 00:23:14.695
I have meetings I need to go to.

393
00:23:14.695 --> 00:23:18.895
I can certainly look into this and see what we can do to fix it.

394
00:23:18.895 --> 00:23:26.335
But I want to set context that our policy is to only replace laptops if all other options have been exhausted.

395
00:23:26.335 --> 00:23:29.095
I don't need you to go snooping around my computer.

396
00:23:29.095 --> 00:23:30.095
Just give me a new one.

397
00:23:30.095 --> 00:23:32.095
Gail, I'd love to do that for you.

398
00:23:32.095 --> 00:23:33.095
But I...

399
00:23:33.095 --> 00:23:33.775
That's ridiculous.

400
00:23:33.775 --> 00:23:35.215
I'm a director.

401
00:23:35.215 --> 00:23:36.835
I should be able to get a new laptop.

402
00:23:36.835 --> 00:23:38.735
I have no time for this.

403
00:23:38.735 --> 00:23:40.495
I completely understand.

404
00:23:40.495 --> 00:23:43.675
Can you let me have five minutes to do a quick triage

405
00:23:43.675 --> 00:23:46.715
and then we can discuss next steps?

406
00:23:46.715 --> 00:23:48.455
If the user is crossing the line

407
00:23:48.455 --> 00:23:50.495
and making you feel uncomfortable,

408
00:23:50.495 --> 00:23:53.255
ignoring it can feel like the easiest solution.

409
00:23:53.255 --> 00:23:54.375
It isn't.

410
00:23:54.375 --> 00:23:57.795
Remember that if you do, the next person they interact with

411
00:23:57.795 --> 00:23:59.555
will be treated the same way.

412
00:23:59.555 --> 00:24:00.955
And that's not okay.

413
00:24:00.955 --> 00:24:03.415
It's also easy to say that the person being attacked

414
00:24:03.415 --> 00:24:05.315
needs to stand up for themselves.

415
00:24:05.315 --> 00:24:06.815
But in situations like this one,

416
00:24:06.835 --> 00:24:08.215
that's really hard.

417
00:24:08.795 --> 00:24:11.975
Ideally, bystanders would call out this behavior in a calm way.

418
00:24:12.515 --> 00:24:15.915
It's also important that you escalate these issues to the appropriate channel,

419
00:24:16.355 --> 00:24:20.275
whether that's your manager, the Human Resources Department, whomever.

420
00:24:21.415 --> 00:24:24.535
Disclaimer, I love being in the IT support field,

421
00:24:24.835 --> 00:24:26.635
and I don't want to dwell on the negative,

422
00:24:27.075 --> 00:24:29.575
but I do want to prepare you for what you might encounter.

423
00:24:30.015 --> 00:24:32.355
So let me throw another tough scenario at you.

424
00:24:32.695 --> 00:24:35.515
You might find that a user skims over what you wrote

425
00:24:35.515 --> 00:24:39.515
or doesn't listen to the full instructions you present before taking action.

426
00:24:39.515 --> 00:24:42.515
When this happens, be patient.

427
00:24:42.515 --> 00:24:47.515
You've likely been on the other end of this before when you ignored instructions.

428
00:24:47.515 --> 00:24:50.515
Why? Were you overwhelmed with the information?

429
00:24:50.515 --> 00:24:51.515
Were you in a hurry?

430
00:24:51.515 --> 00:24:53.515
Maybe you need reading glasses.

431
00:24:53.515 --> 00:24:57.515
Whatever the case might be, the best tactic is to break these steps down

432
00:24:57.515 --> 00:25:01.515
into smaller, more digestible pieces for the user.

433
00:25:01.515 --> 00:25:04.515
If you sent them an article that they didn't finish reading,

434
00:25:04.515 --> 00:25:08.635
ask where specifically in the documentation they're having issues

435
00:25:08.635 --> 00:25:11.815
so that you don't have to bore them with the parts they already know.

436
00:25:11.815 --> 00:25:15.035
Sometimes you'll come across someone wanting to bend a policy

437
00:25:15.035 --> 00:25:17.275
or push back on an established process.

438
00:25:17.275 --> 00:25:20.675
Take this as a sign to look deeper into the situation.

439
00:25:20.675 --> 00:25:25.275
Is it really a company policy or just a common way of doing things?

440
00:25:25.275 --> 00:25:28.515
If it is a policy, is there a documentation of it?

441
00:25:28.515 --> 00:25:30.515
You can reference that to the user.

442
00:25:30.515 --> 00:25:34.015
If not, offer to follow up to get a definitive answer.

443
00:25:34.015 --> 00:25:35.955
You might be surprised what you find.

444
00:25:36.615 --> 00:25:41.495
The takeaway here is that it's important to try to see things from other people's point of view.

445
00:25:42.095 --> 00:25:49.895
In that moment, when you're feeling riled up and frustrated, take a minute to see the situation from the other person's perspective.

446
00:25:50.395 --> 00:25:52.495
If you were them, how would you be feeling?

447
00:25:53.035 --> 00:25:54.575
What would make you feel better?

448
00:25:55.055 --> 00:26:00.295
If you can train yourself to see things from another's perspective, you're on your way to turn things around.

449
00:26:01.295 --> 00:26:03.995
