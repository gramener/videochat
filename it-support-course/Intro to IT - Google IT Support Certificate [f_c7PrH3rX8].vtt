00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320
There's a big problem in the world right now.

1
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.380
There are hundreds of thousands of IT support jobs just waiting for skilled candidates to fill them.

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.020
They're available at this very moment, and there are companies large and small that really want to hire motivated people.

3
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:20.080
With technology seeping into nearly every aspect of business, that need is growing by the second, but that's just half the story.

4
00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:28.540
There are lots of people around the world, like you, who are looking for a flexible way to learn the skills necessary to get that entry-level IT support role.

5
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.040
but there might be a few obstacles in the way.

6
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.880
Maybe you don't have a university degree or the access or

7
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.980
flexibility to take in-person trainings, or maybe the cost is just too high.

8
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.920
Whatever the reason, you're looking for an accessible,

9
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.940
hands-on way to learn the skills that companies are hiring for.

10
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.560
Google and Coursera are thrilled to welcome you to

11
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.360
the IT Support Professional Certificate Program.

12
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.420
This program is designed to give you the foundational skills and

13
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.060
confidence required for an entry-level IT support role.

14
00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.000
whether that's doing in-person support or remote support or both.

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.220
What's really special about this program is that learners get a hands-on

16
00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.980
experience through a dynamic mix of labs and other interactive exercises,

17
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.180
just like what you'd encounter in a help desk role.

18
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.780
This curriculum is designed to get you job ready, but

19
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.580
we're taking it one step further.

20
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:32.467
When you complete this program you have your opportunity to share your information with Google Bank of America and other top employers looking to hire entry IT support professionals This program has been designed to teach anyone who interested in learning the foundational skills in IT support

21
00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:36.867
Doesn't matter if you've been tinkering with IT on your own or you're completely new to the field.

22
00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:42.307
We'll bring the content developed entirely by Googlers, and you bring the passion and motivation to learn it.

23
00:01:42.307 --> 00:01:43.867
Here's how we're going to get there.

24
00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:50.407
This program is rooted in the belief that a strong foundation in IT support can serve as a launchpad to a meaningful career in IT.

25
00:01:50.407 --> 00:02:02.907
And so we've designed industry relevant courses, technical support fundamentals, computer networking, operating systems, system administration, IT infrastructure services and IT security.

26
00:02:03.107 --> 00:02:09.587
If you dedicate around eight to 10 hours a week to the courses, we anticipate that you'll complete the certificate in about eight months.

27
00:02:09.747 --> 00:02:12.627
And learning this stuff won't be like your typical classroom experience.

28
00:02:12.627 --> 00:02:17.507
You can move the material at your own pace, skip content that you might already know,

29
00:02:17.507 --> 00:02:21.007
or review the lessons again if you need a refresher.

30
00:02:21.007 --> 00:02:23.687
It's a choose your own adventure experience.

31
00:02:23.687 --> 00:02:28.067
Plus, we think that the length is a strong signal to employers that you have the grit

32
00:02:28.067 --> 00:02:32.007
and persistence it takes to succeed in an ever changing field like IT.

33
00:02:32.007 --> 00:02:36.087
Another really cool part about this program is that it's been created entirely by

34
00:02:36.087 --> 00:02:50.234
real world pros who have a strong background in IT support They work in IT fields like operations engineering security site reliability engineering and systems administration They know this content because they live it every day
