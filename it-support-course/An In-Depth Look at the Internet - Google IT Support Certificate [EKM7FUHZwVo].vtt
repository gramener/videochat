Hi, my name is Victor Escobito, and I'm a corporate operations engineer.

1
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.360
I'm excited to spend the next few lessons with you before my colleague and friend Gian

2
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.360
takes the reins and wraps up the rest of the lessons on the internet.

3
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.720
Before we dive in though, I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself.

4
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.440
My passion for IT began way back when I was nine years old, and my dad brought home our first

5
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.440
computer.

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.980
He was a mechanical engineer and started using the computer to help him with his CAD work.

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.820
This was the first time I was exposed to computers and later realized you can install new

8
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.440
software on it, including computer games.

9
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.140
As I tinkered with a computer, shortly to my dad's dismay, I became more and more interested

10
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.440
in how it worked and eventually started to open up the case and peek inside.

11
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.800
I found pieces that could be removed and even some that shouldn't, learning through trial

12
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.680
and error along the way.

13
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.420
I couldn't really explain what it was, but I just found the mechanics of how it all worked

14
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.400
together so fascinating.

15
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.940
Looking back, these were the seeds that inspired my career.

16
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.380
But you see where I grew up, going to college and pursuing a career wasn't exactly talked about or heavily encouraged.

17
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.840
I'm a first generation Mexican American and there weren't a lot of people I knew pursuing a career in tech.

18
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.780
My friends and family were mostly worrying about graduating high school and making sure they had jobs not really thinking about careers.

19
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.600
My school didn't have the resources to offer many technical classes and even though my father was working in mechanical engineering,

20
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.620
computers were a tool to him, like a mill, ruler, or a hammer.

21
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.160
My parents encouraged me to work hard and pursue computers,

22
00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.920
but they couldn't really give advice about college or a career in tech.

23
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.640
To no real fault of their own, they just didn't have the necessary experience.

24
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.160
When I decided to go to college, I decided to try my hand at computer science,

25
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.660
since it could feed my curiosity for how computers worked at a more fundamental level.

26
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.240
I realized that having this foundational knowledge really allowed me to understand

27
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.080
some of the higher level concepts that were important in a career in tech.

28
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.480
So while in school, I took on my first IT job for a local small company.

29
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.520
I've been working in IT now for 12 years, with the last seven years being here at Google.

30
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.600
I now work on managing deployments of large internal IT projects for the company.

31
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.840
Applying the knowledge I picked up over the years in my initial IT help desk roles

32
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.120
to make sure that I understand how I'm impacting our users and various support teams.

33
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.160
Now that you know a little bit about me, let's dig into the

34
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:31.240
internet. The internet made it possible for us to connect with almost anyone in the world.

35
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:36.680
Before the internet, you had to use paper maps and write down step-by-step directions to get

36
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.120
where you wanted to go. If you wanted to see what your friends were up to, you'd have to call them,

37
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.480
actually talk to them. If you wanted to learn something new, you had to go to a library and

38
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.960
hope they have a book on the subject you wanted to learn. People didn't really discover new

39
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.080
restaurants unless they heard about it from someone else or it was absolutely.

40
00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.540
advertised. There was no Yelp or other website that rates restaurants like we have today.

41
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.860
For some of us, life without the internet seems unimaginable. We get it. It's become an integral

42
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:12.020
part of our lives. In the next few lessons, you'll be learning about what the internet is,

43
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.740
how it came to be, and how it has impacted us both in negative and positive ways.

44
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.180
When most people think of the internet, they think of a magical cloud that

45
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.000
lets you access your favorite websites, shop online,

46
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.180
and you have seemingly endless stream of cat pictures.

47
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.140
But there isn't any magic involved.

48
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.240
There's no mysterious entity that grants us a cat picture on demand.

49
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.040
The internet is just an interconnection of computers

50
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.440
around the world, like a giant spider web

51
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.520
that brings all of us together.

52
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.200
We call the interconnection of computers a network.

53
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.280
Computers in a network can talk to each other

54
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.960
and send data to one another.

55
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.220
You can create a simple network with just two

56
00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.060
computers. In fact, you might already have your own network at home connecting all of your home devices.

57
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:07.700
Let's think on a bigger scale. What about the computers at your school or workplace? Are they in a

58
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:14.220
network? They sure are. All of the computers there are linked together in a network. Can we link

59
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.779
your home, school, and workplace networks together? We absolutely can. Your workplace connects to a

60
00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:25.220
bigger network and that network connects to an even bigger network and on and on. Aventer

61
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.600
Eventually, you've got billions of computers that are interconnected, making up what we call

62
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.720
the internet.

63
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.820
You, like most people, probably access the internet through a browser like Mozilla Firefox,

64
00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.840
Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, or something else.

65
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.040
This is done through the World Wide Web, but don't make the mistake of thinking the Internet

66
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.820
is the World Wide Web.

67
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.140
The Internet is the physical connection of computers and wires around the world.

68
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.600
The web is the information on the internet.

69
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.940
We use it to access the internet through a link like

70
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.780
www.gou.goule.com.

71
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.580
The World Wide Web isn't the only way we can access the internet.

72
00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.760
Your email, chat, and file sharing programs

73
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.720
are also ways you can access the internet.

74
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.020
In the IT field, managing, building, and designing networks

75
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.940
is known as networking.

76
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.500
Networking is a super important and large field in IT.

77
00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:22.900
There are specialized jobs,

78
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.580
college degree programs and tons of literature dedicated entirely to networking.

79
00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:33.020
If you work in the IT field, it's super critical that you understand the fundamentals of networking.

80
00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.660
So how does it all work?

81
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.900
To answer that question, we're going to need a lot more time.

82
00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.080
Fortunately, we have a separate course entirely dedicated to this topic.

83
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.140
We'll only cover the high-level overview of networking here.

84
00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:50.620
The internet is composed of a massive network of satellites, cellular networks, and physical

85
00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.660
cables buried in underneath the ground.

86
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.160
We don't actually connect to the internet directly.

87
00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.900
Instead, computers called servers connect directly to the internet.

88
00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:05.580
Servers store the websites that we use, like Wikipedia, Google, Reddit, and BBC.

89
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.080
These websites serve content.

90
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.340
The machines that we use, like our mobile phones, laptops, video game consoles, and more,

91
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.300
are called clients.

92
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.900
Clients request the content, like pictures, websites from the servers.

93
00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.640
Clients don't connect directly to the internet.

94
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:30.420
Instead, they connect to a network run by an internet service provider, or ISP, like CenturyLink,

95
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.920
Level 3, Comcast, Telefonica, and things like that.

96
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.660
ISPs have already built networks and run all the necessary physical cabling that connects

97
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.100
millions of computers together in one network.

98
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.100
They also connect to other networks and other ISPs.

99
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:51.900
These other networks connect to the networks of Google, Reddit, universities.

100
00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:58.320
all the other networks in the world. Together, they form one giant network of computers called

101
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:04.780
the internet. But how do the clients know how to get to servers? Well, how would you send a letter

102
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.660
to someone? You'd put your address on the letter and send it to the address of the person you're

103
00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:15.860
sending the letter to. Computers have addresses, just like houses. Computers on a network have an

104
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:21.880
identifier called an IP address. An IP address is composed of digits and numbers like 100.

105
00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:30.820
100.1.4.3. When we want to access a website like www.coursera.com, we're actually going to their

106
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:39.920
IP address, like 172.217.6.46. Devices that can connect to a network have another unique identifier

107
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:46.340
called a Mac address. Mac addresses are generally permanent and hard-coded onto a device.

108
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:51.880
A sample Mac address can be something like this. When you send or receive data,

109
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.900
through a network, you need to have both an IP and a Mac address.

110
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.900
You might be wondering why we need to have two different numbers

111
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:00.900
to identify something.

112
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.900
That's a good question.

113
00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.900
Think again of the letter analogy we used before.

114
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.900
An IP address is your house address,

115
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.900
while the Mac address is the name of the recipient of the letter.

116
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.900
You want to make sure your letter gets to the right location

117
00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.900
and to the right person.

118
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.900
A more simplified example of the letter delivery would go like this.

119
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.940
I'm in New York City and I got a letter that I want to send to a friend, May.

120
00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.660
May is halfway across the world in Tokyo,

121
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.140
so our letter will go through lots of places before it reaches her.

122
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:34.059
I put her name and address on there,

123
00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:36.659
and I also put my name and address on there too.

124
00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:38.900
When I drop my letter off at the post office,

125
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.500
the mail person looks at it.

126
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.840
He thinks, I don't know how to get to Tokyo from here,

127
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.260
but there's a truck that's headed to Texas.

128
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.700
He puts my letter in that truck.

129
00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.220
At the post office in Texas,

130
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.300
a male person looks at the letter and says,

131
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.400
I don't know how to get to Tokyo from here,

132
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.080
but we have a truck going to San Francisco.

133
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.200
She puts my letter in that truck.

134
00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.040
At the post office in San Francisco,

135
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.880
yet another male person looks at my letter.

136
00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.880
He says, oh, there's a plane headed to Tokyo

137
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:14.562
and puts the letter on that plane When it finally reaches Tokyo the postman there says oh I know where May lives and delivers the letter to her Obviously there are many more nuance

138
00:09:14.562 --> 00:09:17.142
to mail delivery than what I described,

139
00:09:17.142 --> 00:09:18.702
but this process is similar

140
00:09:18.702 --> 00:09:21.522
to how information gets routed across the internet.

141
00:09:21.522 --> 00:09:25.122
One thing to call out is that data that's sent through a network

142
00:09:25.122 --> 00:09:26.642
is sent through packets.

143
00:09:26.642 --> 00:09:28.682
They're little bits of data,

144
00:09:28.682 --> 00:09:31.482
and you guessed it, ones and zeros.

145
00:09:31.482 --> 00:09:34.102
It doesn't matter if it's pictures, email,

146
00:09:34.102 --> 00:09:35.602
music, or text.

147
00:09:35.602 --> 00:09:37.402
When we move data through the network,

148
00:09:37.402 --> 00:09:39.802
we break them down into packets.

149
00:09:39.802 --> 00:09:42.122
When a packet gets to its destination,

150
00:09:42.122 --> 00:09:44.662
it will rearrange itself back in order.

151
00:09:44.662 --> 00:09:46.762
Think of a packet like a letter.

152
00:09:46.762 --> 00:09:48.522
Let's actually look at this process again,

153
00:09:48.522 --> 00:09:52.182
but this time we'll use IP addresses and Mac addresses.

154
00:09:52.182 --> 00:09:58.582
Natalie has a computer with IP address 113.8.81.2,

155
00:09:58.582 --> 00:10:02.182
and she wants to go to Google.com and search for pictures of cats.

156
00:10:02.182 --> 00:10:04.082
Before she does that, her computer has to send

157
00:10:04.102 --> 00:10:09.222
a packet to ask google.com if it can access their website. Our packet knows google.com's

158
00:10:09.222 --> 00:10:17.622
IP address is 172.217.6.46. But it doesn't know how to get there just yet. The packet

159
00:10:17.622 --> 00:10:23.382
travels from one place to another at each destination where it asks, hey, do you know where

160
00:10:23.382 --> 00:10:28.262
a google.com is? Eventually, it'll be routed to another destination that can get the packet

161
00:10:28.262 --> 00:10:34.082
closer and closer to google.com. Once it reaches a destination that can deliver the packet to a

162
00:10:34.102 --> 00:10:35.822
server at google.com?

163
00:10:35.822 --> 00:10:41.342
Google will send Natalie a packet saying she can access an unlimited number of cat pictures.

164
00:10:41.342 --> 00:10:44.862
There are many technical details that we left out in this explanation, but don't worry.

165
00:10:44.862 --> 00:10:48.302
You'll learn all about the nitty-gritty in the networking course of this program.

166
00:10:48.302 --> 00:10:56.622
For now, this is what you need to know about the not-so magic of the internet.

167
00:10:56.622 --> 00:11:00.602
Now that we understand what networks are, let's talk about how they're connected.

168
00:11:00.602 --> 00:11:03.942
There are a lot of ways you can connect computers to a network.

169
00:11:04.102 --> 00:11:06.862
We'll only cover a few of the major ones in this course.

170
00:11:06.862 --> 00:11:11.942
First, there's an Ethernet cable, which lets you physically connect to the network through

171
00:11:11.942 --> 00:11:12.862
a cable.

172
00:11:12.862 --> 00:11:16.862
On the back of the desktop we worked in the previous lessons, there's a network port that

173
00:11:16.862 --> 00:11:19.442
you plug your Ethernet cable into.

174
00:11:19.442 --> 00:11:24.082
Another way to connect to a network is through Wi-Fi, which is wireless networking.

175
00:11:24.082 --> 00:11:29.282
Most modern computing systems have wireless capabilities like mobile phones, smart televisions,

176
00:11:29.282 --> 00:11:30.482
and laptops.

177
00:11:30.482 --> 00:11:33.862
We connect to wireless networks through radios and antennas.

178
00:11:34.102 --> 00:11:38.482
The glass method will go over uses fiber optic cables to connect to a network.

179
00:11:38.482 --> 00:11:43.142
This is the most expensive method since fiber optic cables allow greater speeds than all the

180
00:11:43.142 --> 00:11:44.142
other methods.

181
00:11:44.142 --> 00:11:49.542
Fiber optic gets its name because the cables contain glass fibers that move data through

182
00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:52.082
light instead of electricity.

183
00:11:52.082 --> 00:11:56.422
This means that we send ones and zeros through a beam of light instead of an electrical

184
00:11:56.422 --> 00:11:58.382
current through a copper wire.

185
00:11:58.382 --> 00:11:59.882
How cool is that?

186
00:11:59.882 --> 00:12:02.502
But our cables have to connect to something.

187
00:12:02.502 --> 00:12:07.382
We don't just have millions of cables going in and out of computers to connect them together.

188
00:12:07.382 --> 00:12:12.662
Instead, computers connect to a few different devices that help organize our network together.

189
00:12:12.662 --> 00:12:16.002
The first device that your computer connects to is a router.

190
00:12:16.002 --> 00:12:21.082
A router connects lots of different devices together and helps route network traffic.

191
00:12:21.082 --> 00:12:27.042
Let's say we have four computers, A, B, C, and D, connected together through a router in the

192
00:12:27.042 --> 00:12:28.702
same network.

193
00:12:28.702 --> 00:12:31.382
You want to send a file from computer A to computer B.

194
00:12:31.382 --> 00:12:39.222
Our packets go through the router and the router utilizes network protocols to help determine where to send the packet.

195
00:12:39.542 --> 00:12:41.722
We'll cover network protocols in the next video.

196
00:12:42.182 --> 00:12:47.802
For now, just know that our router uses a set of rules to figure out where to send our data.

197
00:12:48.422 --> 00:12:52.202
So now our packet gets routed from computer A to computer B.

198
00:12:52.702 --> 00:12:52.862
Sweet.

199
00:12:53.542 --> 00:12:57.182
What if we wanted to send a packet to a computer not in our network?

200
00:12:57.182 --> 00:13:02.182
What if we wanted to send a packet to our friend Alejandro's computer?

201
00:13:02.182 --> 00:13:05.182
Alejandro is on a different network altogether.

202
00:13:05.182 --> 00:13:08.882
Fortunately, our router knows how to handle that too.

203
00:13:08.882 --> 00:13:13.582
The packet will get routed outsider network to our ISPs network.

204
00:13:13.582 --> 00:13:18.682
Using networking protocols, it's able to figure out where Alejandro's computer is.

205
00:13:18.682 --> 00:13:24.682
During this process, our packet is traveling across many different routers, switches, and hubs.

206
00:13:24.682 --> 00:13:29.082
Switches and hubs are also devices that help our data travel.

207
00:13:29.082 --> 00:13:31.722
Think of switches like mail rooms in a building.

208
00:13:31.722 --> 00:13:34.162
Routers get our letters to the building,

209
00:13:34.162 --> 00:13:36.882
but once we're inside, we use the mailroom

210
00:13:36.882 --> 00:13:39.002
to figure out where to send a letter.

211
00:13:39.002 --> 00:13:41.542
Hubs are like company memos.

212
00:13:41.542 --> 00:13:43.682
They don't know who to send the memo to,

213
00:13:43.682 --> 00:13:45.322
so they send it to everyone.

214
00:13:45.322 --> 00:13:48.142
Working with network devices is important to understand,

215
00:13:48.142 --> 00:13:50.642
because it's likely that one day you'll have users

216
00:13:50.642 --> 00:13:52.882
reporting problems accessing the internet.

217
00:13:52.882 --> 00:13:54.662
You'll want to investigate your way up

218
00:13:54.682 --> 00:14:00.962
the network stack, a technology stack, in this case, a network stack, is just a set of hardware

219
00:14:00.962 --> 00:14:04.882
or software that provides the infrastructure for a computer.

220
00:14:04.882 --> 00:14:09.722
So the network stack is all the components that makes up computer networking.

221
00:14:09.722 --> 00:14:12.602
You might need to investigate the network stack in your job.

222
00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:16.602
You'd start with making sure the end-user computers are working properly.

223
00:14:16.602 --> 00:14:21.182
Then you'd turn your attention to other possible points of failure, like the cabling, switches,

224
00:14:21.182 --> 00:14:24.442
and routers that work together to access the internet.

225
00:14:24.442 --> 00:14:27.562
We'll dive a little deeper into the different networking devices

226
00:14:27.562 --> 00:14:28.762
in the networking course.

227
00:14:28.762 --> 00:14:31.682
For now, let's route ourselves to the next lesson,

228
00:14:31.682 --> 00:14:33.042
the language of the internet.

229
00:14:37.202 --> 00:14:39.322
We talked briefly about the networking protocols

230
00:14:39.322 --> 00:14:41.702
our devices used to help our packets get

231
00:14:41.702 --> 00:14:44.122
from one destination to another destination.

232
00:14:44.122 --> 00:14:45.362
But what are they?

233
00:14:45.362 --> 00:14:47.802
There are lots and lots of network protocols used

234
00:14:47.802 --> 00:14:50.542
and they're all necessary to help us get our packets

235
00:14:50.542 --> 00:14:51.562
in the right place.

236
00:14:51.562 --> 00:14:54.422
Think of network protocols, like a set of rules,

237
00:14:54.442 --> 00:14:56.482
for how we transfer data in a network.

238
00:14:56.822 --> 00:14:59.062
Imagine if you sent a letter to your friend Sasha

239
00:14:59.062 --> 00:15:00.182
who lives in California,

240
00:15:00.662 --> 00:15:03.502
but your post office sends it out to another Sasha

241
00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:04.742
who lives out in New York.

242
00:15:04.902 --> 00:15:06.242
That would hopefully never happen

243
00:15:06.242 --> 00:15:07.962
since the post office has rules

244
00:15:07.962 --> 00:15:09.982
that they follow to make sure your letter

245
00:15:09.982 --> 00:15:11.402
is sent to the correct address.

246
00:15:11.762 --> 00:15:13.902
Our networking protocols do the same thing.

247
00:15:14.202 --> 00:15:16.262
There are rules that make sure our packets

248
00:15:16.262 --> 00:15:17.582
are routed efficiently,

249
00:15:18.182 --> 00:15:19.982
aren't corrupted, are secure,

250
00:15:20.742 --> 00:15:21.742
go to the right machine,

251
00:15:22.102 --> 00:15:23.322
and are named appropriately.

252
00:15:23.762 --> 00:15:24.422
You get the idea.

253
00:15:24.442 --> 00:15:29.982
What will cover specific network protocols later on, but there are two protocols that you need to know.

254
00:15:30.382 --> 00:15:39.062
The transmission control protocol and the internet protocol, or TCPIP for short, which have become the predominant protocols of the internet.

255
00:15:39.062 --> 00:15:44.762
The internet protocol, or IP, is responsible for delivering our packets to the right computers.

256
00:15:45.482 --> 00:15:48.742
Remember those addresses that computers use to find something on a network?

257
00:15:49.382 --> 00:15:52.742
They're called IP addresses, or internet protocol addresses.

258
00:15:52.742 --> 00:15:55.802
The internet protocol helps us route information.

259
00:15:56.262 --> 00:16:05.182
The Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP, is a protocol that handles reliable delivery of information from one network to another.

260
00:16:06.042 --> 00:16:12.482
This protocol was an important part of the creation of the internet since it led us share information with other computers.

261
00:16:12.942 --> 00:16:18.902
We'll spend a lot of time diving into these protocols in the next course, the bits and bytes of computer networking.

262
00:16:19.162 --> 00:16:19.742
So stay tuned.

263
00:16:20.422 --> 00:16:22.722
For now, you've got a high-level understanding.

264
00:16:22.742 --> 00:16:25.742
of how the internet works with TCP IP.

265
00:16:29.742 --> 00:16:31.742
Lots of different ways to use the internet.

266
00:16:31.742 --> 00:16:35.742
We all know that, but I want to cover one of the more prevalent ways

267
00:16:35.742 --> 00:16:38.742
that people access the internet through the web.

268
00:16:38.742 --> 00:16:42.742
All websites can be accessed through the web.

269
00:16:42.742 --> 00:16:44.742
Websites are basically text documents

270
00:16:44.742 --> 00:16:49.742
that we format with HTML or hypertext markup language.

271
00:16:49.742 --> 00:16:51.742
It's a coding language used by web browsers.

272
00:16:51.742 --> 00:16:58.582
by web browsers. Webpages are generally made up of very basic components. They contain multimedia

273
00:16:58.582 --> 00:17:04.982
content like text, images, audio, and video. When you want to navigate to a website, you

274
00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:14.642
would type in a URL like www.reddit.com. A URL, which stands for Uniform Resource Locator,

275
00:17:14.642 --> 00:17:20.922
is just a web address similar to a home address. Notice the www. in the URL? It stands for

276
00:17:20.922 --> 00:17:28.622
worldwide web. The second portion, Reddit.com, is something we call a domain name. Anyone can register

277
00:17:28.622 --> 00:17:34.642
a domain name. It's just our website name. Once a name is taken, it'll be registered to ICANN,

278
00:17:35.022 --> 00:17:40.762
the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers. Once a domain name is registered with ICANN,

279
00:17:41.142 --> 00:17:46.242
no one else can take that name unless it becomes available again. The last part of the URL,

280
00:17:46.662 --> 00:17:50.902
in this case is dot com, but you can also use different domain ending,

281
00:17:50.922 --> 00:17:57.722
like Reddit.net or Reddit.org, the different domain name endings are standards for what type of

282
00:17:57.722 --> 00:18:03.942
website it might be. So a domain that ends in.edu is mainly used for educational institutions.

283
00:18:04.482 --> 00:18:10.202
Remember how computers use IP addresses to find another computer? Well, you can do the same if you

284
00:18:10.202 --> 00:18:24.025
wanted to find a computer on the internet Let go ahead and type 172 into a web browser and hit enter Wait a minute what happened How come we at Google homepage

285
00:18:24.025 --> 00:18:32.305
It turns out the IP address 172.217.6.46 maps to Google's homepage through a critical

286
00:18:32.305 --> 00:18:36.145
web protocol domain name system or DNS.

287
00:18:36.145 --> 00:18:43.405
DNS acts like our internet's directory and lets us use human readable words to map to an IP address.

288
00:18:43.645 --> 00:18:46.405
The computer doesn't know what Google.com is.

289
00:18:46.405 --> 00:18:48.925
It only knows how to get to an IP address.

290
00:18:48.925 --> 00:18:53.525
With DNS, it's able to map Google's IP address with Google.com.

291
00:18:53.525 --> 00:18:57.605
Every time you go on a website, your computer is performing a DNS lookup

292
00:18:57.605 --> 00:19:01.685
to find the IP address of the website name you typed in.

293
00:19:01.685 --> 00:19:06.965
This trick can be a good first step in diagnosing certain kinds of DNS issues.

294
00:19:06.965 --> 00:19:11.445
So if you're able to access a website by its IP address,

295
00:19:11.445 --> 00:19:14.445
but not its human-readable domain name,

296
00:19:14.445 --> 00:19:17.365
then there's a good bet that there's probably a problem

297
00:19:17.365 --> 00:19:21.065
somewhere in the DNS configuration your network is using.

298
00:19:21.065 --> 00:19:24.225
Understanding IP addresses can come in handy

299
00:19:24.225 --> 00:19:27.045
in all sorts of other situations you might encounter

300
00:19:27.045 --> 00:19:28.765
as an IT support specialist.

301
00:19:28.765 --> 00:19:31.445
The source of internet requests are usually identified

302
00:19:31.445 --> 00:19:33.965
by IP addresses in server logs.

303
00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:36.445
Many pieces of IT infrastructure need to have

304
00:19:36.445 --> 00:19:38.545
some kind of IP address configuration

305
00:19:38.545 --> 00:19:40.925
applied to them in order to work.

306
00:19:40.925 --> 00:19:45.045
DNS is a huge system and we'll be discussing more about it later.

307
00:19:45.045 --> 00:19:47.965
Now that you understand the basics of how the internet works,

308
00:19:47.965 --> 00:19:53.245
I'll sign out for now and leave you in the very capable hands of my friend and colleague Gian Spikusa.

309
00:19:53.245 --> 00:19:57.365
I'll see you again in course two, the bits and bytes of computer networking.

310
00:19:57.365 --> 00:20:02.925
But in the next lessons, Gian is going to talk about the incredible boom of the internet age.

311
00:20:06.925 --> 00:20:10.905
You've learned what the internet is and a little bit about how it works.

312
00:20:10.925 --> 00:20:14.685
Now, we're going to take a step back and learn why it was created.

313
00:20:14.685 --> 00:20:17.325
But before we do that, I'd like to introduce myself.

314
00:20:17.325 --> 00:20:21.325
My name is Gian Spacusa, and I'm a program manager in Android Security.

315
00:20:21.325 --> 00:20:29.245
I help protect Android's 2 billion-plus users by managing new security features for each of Android's desserts, or versions of Android.

316
00:20:29.245 --> 00:20:34.125
I've always loved technology, and I've worked in IT since I was 16 and throughout university.

317
00:20:34.125 --> 00:20:39.645
I would fill my past time reading about new tech and building servers from old computer parts in my basement.

318
00:20:39.645 --> 00:20:43.825
My earliest memory of working on tech is waiting for my parents to go to sleep so I could

319
00:20:43.825 --> 00:20:48.405
quietly dial up the internet while the phone was free and just browse websites all night long

320
00:20:48.405 --> 00:20:50.805
and read about random tech things.

321
00:20:50.805 --> 00:20:55.685
My first jobs were as a one-person IT crew at three nonprofit organizations.

322
00:20:55.685 --> 00:21:00.525
It was both stressful and really exciting to be responsible for everything, from configuring

323
00:21:00.525 --> 00:21:05.585
and administrating backup servers to just showing new employees how to access email and use their

324
00:21:05.585 --> 00:21:06.885
computers.

325
00:21:06.885 --> 00:21:08.965
I'm really excited to be here with you.

326
00:21:08.965 --> 00:21:12.925
I was never a really great test taker, and my grades reflected that.

327
00:21:12.925 --> 00:21:17.125
But I knew with hard work and perseverance, I could build a great career in IT.

328
00:21:17.125 --> 00:21:18.165
And so can you.

329
00:21:18.165 --> 00:21:22.425
So let's get started and dig in a bit more on the Internet.

330
00:21:22.425 --> 00:21:25.725
The Internet has become an essential part of our lives.

331
00:21:25.725 --> 00:21:29.725
Our bank accounts, entertainment, news, and education are all on the Internet.

332
00:21:29.725 --> 00:21:34.185
It's important to learn why that is, since some of the original designs of the Internet

333
00:21:34.185 --> 00:21:35.845
have reached their limitations.

334
00:21:35.845 --> 00:21:38.945
As an IT support specialist, you should understand what they're

335
00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:41.505
the future of the internet holds and why.

336
00:21:41.505 --> 00:21:44.565
Let's go back in time to the 1950s where it all started.

337
00:21:44.565 --> 00:21:47.945
Remember, back then, computers were huge and bulky.

338
00:21:47.945 --> 00:21:52.545
If you were a programmer, you needed to directly interact with these massive computers.

339
00:21:52.545 --> 00:21:57.145
That would get real old, real fast, especially if you had several people who wanted to use

340
00:21:57.145 --> 00:22:00.045
the only computing resource available.

341
00:22:00.045 --> 00:22:04.925
In the late 1960s, the US government spun up a project called DARPA.

342
00:22:04.925 --> 00:22:08.945
It went on to create the earliest version of the internet that we see today, with the last

343
00:22:08.965 --> 00:22:15.245
the ARPANET. Eventually, computer programmers were able to share a single computing resource

344
00:22:15.245 --> 00:22:20.485
by being able to remotely access the computer. But there was still a big problem. Networks

345
00:22:20.485 --> 00:22:25.085
couldn't talk to each other. It wasn't until the 1970s that we had a critical breakthrough

346
00:22:25.085 --> 00:22:29.445
in computer networking that fixed this problem. It was thanks to computer scientists

347
00:22:29.445 --> 00:22:35.225
Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn, who created the method we call the transmission control protocol

348
00:22:35.225 --> 00:22:39.025
and the Internet Protocol, or TCPIP.

349
00:22:39.025 --> 00:22:45.325
First, only a handful of computers and universities, governments, and businesses adopt TCPIP,

350
00:22:45.325 --> 00:22:50.725
then hundreds, and then, in the span of 50 years, billions of computers.

351
00:22:50.725 --> 00:22:54.325
TCPIP is the protocol that we use on the Internet today.

352
00:22:54.325 --> 00:22:59.725
Finally, people around the world could send data to one another, but they were still a problem.

353
00:22:59.725 --> 00:23:02.025
The information they sent was just text.

354
00:23:02.025 --> 00:23:05.025
It wasn't centralized and it was pretty bland.

355
00:23:05.025 --> 00:23:11.785
Then, in the 1990s, a computer scientist by the name of Tim Burns Lee invented the World Wide Web.

356
00:23:11.785 --> 00:23:16.805
It utilized different protocols for displaying information and web pages and became the predominant

357
00:23:16.805 --> 00:23:20.425
way of communication and accessing the Internet.

358
00:23:20.425 --> 00:23:24.645
Anyone who had an internet connection at that time was able to access the information source

359
00:23:24.645 --> 00:23:26.225
of the World Wide Web.

360
00:23:26.225 --> 00:23:29.545
It's been 30 years since the creation of the World Wide Web.

361
00:23:29.545 --> 00:23:34.625
We've gone from sending simple email messages and viewing basic web pages to having video chats

362
00:23:34.625 --> 00:23:39.625
and instant news updates, order food, buy books, and even cars in a matter of seconds.

363
00:23:39.625 --> 00:23:43.785
Taking an online course like this wasn't even possible until recently.

364
00:23:43.785 --> 00:23:48.585
The creation of the internet that we know today was the culmination of knowledge and engineering

365
00:23:48.585 --> 00:23:51.625
from many brilliant scientists and organizations.

366
00:23:51.625 --> 00:23:55.825
If you want to learn more about the history of the internet, check out the supplemental reading

367
00:23:55.825 --> 00:23:58.125
and the networking course in this program.

368
00:24:02.125 --> 00:24:04.605
We've mentioned IP addresses a lot in this course.

369
00:24:04.625 --> 00:24:07.125
but we haven't actually gone into detail about them.

370
00:24:07.125 --> 00:24:10.125
They're actually different versions of IP addresses.

371
00:24:10.125 --> 00:24:15.125
The current protocol, Internet Protocol version 4, or IPV4,

372
00:24:15.125 --> 00:24:20.125
is an address that consists of 32 bits separated into four groups.

373
00:24:20.125 --> 00:24:27.125
Remember, 42 bits is 4 bytes, and 1 byte can be stored up to 256 values

374
00:24:27.125 --> 00:24:29.125
from 0 to 255.

375
00:24:29.125 --> 00:24:34.125
So IPV4 addresses can be something like 73.55,

376
00:24:34.125 --> 00:24:41.125
25.242.3. Even though it might seem like a lot of possible IPV4 addresses, there are less

377
00:24:41.125 --> 00:24:47.245
than 4.3 billion IPV4 addresses. There are way more than 4.3 billion websites out on

378
00:24:47.245 --> 00:24:53.025
the web today. Some IPV4 addresses are even reserved for special purposes, so the number

379
00:24:53.025 --> 00:24:58.245
of usable IP addresses is even less. A device that wants to connect to the Internet needs to

380
00:24:58.245 --> 00:25:03.925
have an IP address, but devices around the world have already exceeded those numbers. So, where

381
00:25:03.925 --> 00:25:06.205
Where have we been getting IP addresses?

382
00:25:06.205 --> 00:25:10.345
IP addresses have been able to keep up with the amount of devices in the world thanks

383
00:25:10.345 --> 00:25:15.125
to IPV6 or Internet Protocol version 6 addresses.

384
00:25:15.125 --> 00:25:23.045
IPV6 addresses consist of 128 bits, four times the amount that IPV4 uses, which means

385
00:25:23.045 --> 00:25:25.405
way more devices can have IP addresses.

386
00:25:25.405 --> 00:25:29.645
The adoption of IPV6 addresses has been slow but steady.

387
00:25:29.645 --> 00:25:33.865
Eventually you'll start seeing more and more IPV6 addresses in the wild.

388
00:25:33.925 --> 00:25:43.085
An example, IPV4 address can be something like 172.14.24.1, but an IPV6 address can be

389
00:25:43.085 --> 00:25:48.065
something like what you see here. Quite a bit of a difference, don't you think?

390
00:25:48.065 --> 00:25:55.045
Here's an analogy for how big this difference is between IPV4 and IPV6. With IPV6, there

391
00:25:55.045 --> 00:26:03.825
are two to the 128th power possible IP addresses. Two to the 128th power is an insanely huge number, so huge,

392
00:26:03.925 --> 00:26:08.245
that scientists had trouble describing with words just how big this number is.

393
00:26:08.245 --> 00:26:12.965
So here's an analogy. Think of a grain of sand. If you scoop up a handful,

394
00:26:12.965 --> 00:26:17.765
do you know how many grains you've had in your hand? Probably a lot, but that's not even

395
00:26:17.765 --> 00:26:24.165
close to the number we're talking about. Now, take all the grains of sand in the entire world.

396
00:26:24.165 --> 00:26:30.005
Assuming there are roughly 7.5 times 10 to the 18th power grains of sand in the world,

397
00:26:30.005 --> 00:26:33.605
that still wouldn't be enough IPV6 addresses.

398
00:26:33.925 --> 00:26:36.925
Let's take all the sand from multiple Earths.

399
00:26:36.925 --> 00:26:39.425
Now you're close to what that number would be.

400
00:26:39.425 --> 00:26:41.425
It's a crazy large number.

401
00:26:41.425 --> 00:26:45.925
Just know that we won't be running out of IPV6 addresses anytime soon.

402
00:26:45.925 --> 00:26:49.425
Another mitigation tool that we've been able to use is NAT,

403
00:26:49.425 --> 00:26:51.425
or network address,

404
00:26:51.425 --> 00:26:55.425
this lets organizations use one public IP address

405
00:26:55.425 --> 00:26:57.925
and many private IP addresses within the network.

406
00:26:57.925 --> 00:27:00.925
Think of NAT like a receptionist at a company.

407
00:27:00.925 --> 00:27:03.425
You know what number to dial to get to the company,

408
00:27:03.425 --> 00:27:05.405
And once you reach the receptionist,

409
00:27:05.405 --> 00:27:07.965
he can transfer your call to one of the private numbers

410
00:27:07.965 --> 00:27:09.225
inside the company.

411
00:27:09.225 --> 00:27:13.145
Now, instead of companies using hundreds of public IP addresses,

412
00:27:13.145 --> 00:27:15.285
they can just use one IP address.

413
00:27:15.285 --> 00:27:17.765
Remember the routers we talked about earlier?

414
00:27:17.765 --> 00:27:20.525
One task you might need to perform when you're an IT support

415
00:27:20.525 --> 00:27:32.967
specialist is to configure NAT on a router to facilitate communication between your company network and the outside world There are lots of other limitations that we had to deal with You learn more about them in the networking course

416
00:27:32.967 --> 00:27:37.967
For now, you should have a general understanding of why IPV4 is so limiting for us today,

417
00:27:37.967 --> 00:27:40.967
and how IPV6 helps solve that problem.

418
00:27:44.967 --> 00:27:47.967
There's no doubt that the Internet has made it much easier for us

419
00:27:47.967 --> 00:27:49.967
to connect with our friends and family,

420
00:27:49.967 --> 00:27:51.967
but it's also made it easier to connect with everyone's more.

421
00:27:51.967 --> 00:27:53.967
to connect with everyone else in the world.

422
00:27:53.967 --> 00:27:56.967
We're no longer confined to our local neighborhoods.

423
00:27:56.967 --> 00:27:58.967
Decades ago, if you wanted to sell something,

424
00:27:58.967 --> 00:28:00.967
you'd place your goods in your driveway

425
00:28:00.967 --> 00:28:03.967
and put up signs for a garage sale.

426
00:28:03.967 --> 00:28:06.967
The only way someone would see this is if they drove by your neighborhood

427
00:28:06.967 --> 00:28:08.967
and saw your sign.

428
00:28:08.967 --> 00:28:11.967
We got a little more savvy and started advertising in our local newspaper.

429
00:28:11.967 --> 00:28:13.967
We had to pay to list our ad,

430
00:28:13.967 --> 00:28:17.967
but at least we were able to reach more people in our neighborhood.

431
00:28:17.967 --> 00:28:19.967
Then the internet boom happened,

432
00:28:19.967 --> 00:28:20.967
and we could use sites like Craigslist to post.

433
00:28:20.967 --> 00:28:26.007
at Craigslist to post an advertisement for free and reach more people in our city.

434
00:28:26.007 --> 00:28:30.967
Then we were able to sell the people outside of our city to cities and other states.

435
00:28:30.967 --> 00:28:35.967
Eventually, we could sell the people outside of our own country, all thanks to the Internet.

436
00:28:35.967 --> 00:28:40.367
Globalization is the movement that lets governments, businesses, and organizations

437
00:28:40.367 --> 00:28:44.427
communicate and integrate together on an international scale.

438
00:28:44.427 --> 00:28:48.847
It's been made possible by the Internet and information technology.

439
00:28:48.847 --> 00:28:51.667
can communicate with each other faster.

440
00:28:51.667 --> 00:28:56.087
News happening on the other side of the world reaches us before we can blink.

441
00:28:56.087 --> 00:29:00.427
And global and financial trade have increased dramatically.

442
00:29:00.427 --> 00:29:05.387
Globalization has transformed almost every aspect of human society as we know it.

443
00:29:05.387 --> 00:29:08.567
Media and social movements have become globalized too.

444
00:29:08.567 --> 00:29:13.567
In 2011, several countries in the Middle East started riots and protests against their government

445
00:29:13.567 --> 00:29:16.967
regimes, known as the Arab Spring protests.

446
00:29:16.967 --> 00:29:18.727
Because of outlets like social media, they're more.

447
00:29:18.727 --> 00:29:23.727
movement gained worldwide attention, and citizens of many different countries banded together

448
00:29:23.727 --> 00:29:25.887
to take collective action.

449
00:29:25.887 --> 00:29:30.067
Social media movements like this have been going on for years, gathering together people

450
00:29:30.067 --> 00:29:34.227
from all over the world and unifying them under a single cause.

451
00:29:34.227 --> 00:29:38.107
The Internet has also dramatically changed the way we consume entertainment.

452
00:29:38.107 --> 00:29:42.807
A few years ago, if you wanted to watch something on TV, you had to actually sit in front

453
00:29:42.807 --> 00:29:46.327
of your TV right when it aired, or else you'd miss it.

454
00:29:46.327 --> 00:29:48.547
Then we started recording our shows.

455
00:29:48.547 --> 00:29:52.787
both on VHS and then on things like TiVo, so we could watch them later.

456
00:29:52.787 --> 00:29:58.227
But now we have access to more TV shows and movies than we can ever watch in our entire lifetime

457
00:29:58.227 --> 00:29:59.867
right at our fingertips.

458
00:29:59.867 --> 00:30:03.147
What if you wanted to listen to a new song by your favorite band?

459
00:30:03.147 --> 00:30:06.367
You used to have to wait until they released their album in a store.

460
00:30:06.367 --> 00:30:11.287
And you couldn't just buy one song, you had to buy the entire album on a CD, cassette tape,

461
00:30:11.287 --> 00:30:13.807
or even a vinyl record back in the day.

462
00:30:13.807 --> 00:30:18.527
If you wanted to get the day's news, you had to wait until the next day when the newspaper would print it.

463
00:30:18.547 --> 00:30:25.547
Even then you weren't able to get a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the news you can get on the Internet today.

464
00:30:25.547 --> 00:30:30.547
Retail stores aren't the only place you look when you want to buy something anymore.

465
00:30:30.547 --> 00:30:35.547
Now you can order food, clothes, books, and well, just about anything on the Internet.

466
00:30:35.547 --> 00:30:40.547
But you don't just buy stuff off the web. You can even get an education.

467
00:30:40.547 --> 00:30:46.547
Colleges and universities worldwide are taking education out of the classroom and putting it into your homes.

468
00:30:46.547 --> 00:30:47.547
Online courses are becoming a public.

469
00:30:47.547 --> 00:30:51.547
are becoming a popular way for people to get a quality education

470
00:30:51.547 --> 00:30:54.547
at a more convenient location, time, and price.

471
00:30:54.547 --> 00:30:55.547
And it's not just degrees.

472
00:30:55.547 --> 00:30:58.547
There's an almost infinite amount of educational tools

473
00:30:58.547 --> 00:31:00.547
available on the Internet.

474
00:31:00.547 --> 00:31:03.547
A few years ago, all this information on the Internet

475
00:31:03.547 --> 00:31:06.547
had to be reached through your laptop or guest top.

476
00:31:06.547 --> 00:31:08.547
Now, more than ever, people are going mobile

477
00:31:08.547 --> 00:31:11.547
and can access all of this information with their smartphones.

478
00:31:11.547 --> 00:31:15.547
It's truly an amazing time to be alive in this technological age.

479
00:31:15.547 --> 00:31:16.547
So the take-the-take of this technology.

480
00:31:16.547 --> 00:31:22.447
So the takeaway here is that the only constant in the field of technology is change.

481
00:31:22.447 --> 00:31:28.447
And as an IT support specialist, you'll have to stay on your toes to keep up with this dynamic shifting landscape.

482
00:31:32.447 --> 00:31:36.807
You may have heard of the phrase Internet of Things or IOT.

483
00:31:36.807 --> 00:31:42.047
This concept is pretty new, but already has a major impact on the future of computing.

484
00:31:42.047 --> 00:31:43.947
The concept is fairly simple.

485
00:31:43.947 --> 00:31:48.907
Basically, more and more devices are being connected to the internet in a smarter fashion.

486
00:31:48.907 --> 00:31:51.707
Did you know that there are now smart thermostats?

487
00:31:51.707 --> 00:31:55.547
Instead of manually programming them when you'll be out of the house, they'll just know when

488
00:31:55.547 --> 00:31:58.667
you leave and turn off the air conditioning for you.

489
00:31:58.667 --> 00:32:00.987
And it's not just your thermostat.

490
00:32:00.987 --> 00:32:04.747
Many companies out there are making smarter household devices.

491
00:32:04.747 --> 00:32:08.667
There are fridges that can keep track of what foods you have in there, toasters that can be

492
00:32:08.667 --> 00:32:13.787
controlled by your smartphone, lights that can change depending on your mood, and cars that drive

493
00:32:13.787 --> 00:32:15.827
you instead of you driving them.

494
00:32:15.827 --> 00:32:21.327
The world is moving towards connecting manual devices to the internet and making them smarter.

495
00:32:21.327 --> 00:32:26.547
These decisions have many societal implications, though, especially when it comes to cyber security

496
00:32:26.547 --> 00:32:28.147
or personal privacy.

497
00:32:28.147 --> 00:32:33.407
But there's also a huge potential for IoT to completely transform the world in ways we have yet

498
00:32:33.407 --> 00:32:35.027
to see.

499
00:32:35.027 --> 00:32:40.367
In the future, people may be shocked to learn that we had to do manual things like make your own coffee

500
00:32:40.367 --> 00:32:42.747
or drive to the grocery store.

501
00:32:42.747 --> 00:32:47.347
While you may not experience working with an Internet of Things device, you should be aware

502
00:32:47.347 --> 00:32:50.027
that it will become a large part of the future of computing.

503
00:32:50.027 --> 00:32:57.927
The added convenience made possible by the Internet also makes it harder and harder for

504
00:32:57.927 --> 00:32:59.987
us to maintain anonymity.

505
00:32:59.987 --> 00:33:04.467
When you purchase something online, your buying habits can be logged and you may be targeting

506
00:33:04.467 --> 00:33:05.627
with marketing.

507
00:33:05.627 --> 00:33:10.427
Even when you want to do something simple, like book a dinner reservation, your name, phone number,

508
00:33:10.427 --> 00:33:12.727
email, and maybe even a credit card number or a credit number.

509
00:33:12.747 --> 00:33:19.187
required. Now think about the information you post publicly. Name, pictures, family, friends,

510
00:33:19.187 --> 00:33:23.967
and even your location may be available to anyone online. Be aware of what you're sharing

511
00:33:23.967 --> 00:33:28.747
by reviewing the privacy policy of a service before you use it. It's up to you to decide

512
00:33:28.747 --> 00:33:33.707
if the trade-offs of a service are worth sharing your personal information. In most cases,

513
00:33:33.707 --> 00:33:37.447
companies are trying to build great products that make our lives easier. They may offer

514
00:33:37.447 --> 00:33:42.367
their products for free because you provide them with free data. Just make sure your information

515
00:33:42.367 --> 00:33:44.167
won't fall into the wrong hands.

516
00:33:44.167 --> 00:33:47.207
Privacy doesn't just affect us on a personal scale.

517
00:33:47.207 --> 00:33:49.427
It's also become a concern for governments.

518
00:33:49.427 --> 00:33:52.127
In Europe, data regulation and privacy

519
00:33:52.127 --> 00:33:55.927
are strictly protected to help EU citizens gain more control

520
00:33:55.927 --> 00:33:58.027
over their personal information.

521
00:33:58.027 --> 00:34:01.847
COPA, or the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act,

522
00:34:01.847 --> 00:34:04.447
also regulates the information we showed a children

523
00:34:04.447 --> 00:34:05.987
under the age of 13.

524
00:34:05.987 --> 00:34:09.167
There are many more examples of government regulation of privacy.

525
00:34:09.167 --> 00:34:12.347
It's no longer something we can think of on an individual scale.

526
00:34:12.367 --> 00:34:16.767
Another concern that's grown with the rise of the internet is the issue of copyright.

527
00:34:16.767 --> 00:34:21.167
Imagine you create a beautiful graphic and upload it on the web for your friends to see.

528
00:34:21.167 --> 00:34:26.867
Then some random stranger takes your graphic, claims it as their own, and sells it for profit.

529
00:34:26.867 --> 00:34:34.367
Thankfully, several companies have been founded and designed specifically to help solve this issue of copyright and intellectual property theft.

530
00:34:34.367 --> 00:34:40.367
There are also efforts in place that you've learned about, like open source projects, that benefit from being on the internet.

531
00:34:40.367 --> 00:34:44.207
In these cases, open collaboration allows a project to thrive.

532
00:34:44.207 --> 00:34:46.767
On top of privacy and copyright considerations,

533
00:34:46.767 --> 00:34:51.727
computer security is another issue that you may face in both your personal and professional life.

534
00:34:52.527 --> 00:34:56.207
More and more companies are being targeted in cyber security attacks.

535
00:34:56.207 --> 00:35:02.847
For example, the Wata Cry attack that started in Europe infected hundreds of thousands of computers across the world.

536
00:35:02.847 --> 00:35:07.647
The financial loss of that attack has been estimated over a billion dollars.

537
00:35:07.647 --> 00:35:10.147
Hospital computers were even infected.

538
00:35:10.147 --> 00:35:13.147
In a critical life-threatening moment, every second matters.

539
00:35:13.147 --> 00:35:15.947
Not being able to perform basic medical duties,

540
00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:17.447
like pulling medical records,

541
00:35:17.447 --> 00:35:19.847
took time away from doctors and nurses,

542
00:35:19.847 --> 00:35:22.747
and more importantly, the lives of their patients.

543
00:35:22.747 --> 00:35:24.047
Before the WannaCry attack,

544
00:35:24.047 --> 00:35:26.447
there were lots of other worldwide attacks.

545
00:35:26.447 --> 00:35:30.347
In 2011, the Sony PlayStation Network was attacked,

546
00:35:30.347 --> 00:35:32.947
and around 77 million user accounts

547
00:35:32.947 --> 00:35:35.147
had personal information exposed.

548
00:35:35.147 --> 00:35:37.547
Everything from entire governments to business,

549
00:35:37.547 --> 00:35:41.547
that handle the data of millions of people have been compromised.

550
00:35:41.547 --> 00:35:45.547
Computer security is no longer the job of specialized security engineers.

551
00:35:45.547 --> 00:35:47.547
It's everyone's responsibility.

552
00:35:47.547 --> 00:35:53.547
And as an IT support specialist, you'll need to have a fundamental understanding of computer security.

553
00:35:53.547 --> 00:35:57.547
You'll get to learn these fundamentals in the course IT security,

554
00:35:57.547 --> 00:36:00.547
defense against the digital dark arts, which I'll be teaching you.

555
00:36:00.547 --> 00:36:02.547
I spend every day working in security.

556
00:36:02.547 --> 00:36:07.527
I love working in the field because I get to help protect people and their devices from all over the

557
00:36:07.547 --> 00:36:08.547
the globe.

558
00:36:08.547 --> 00:36:11.827
The security course in this program teaches you just that.

559
00:36:11.827 --> 00:36:16.167
You'll also learn what threats are out there and how you can prevent and mitigate them

560
00:36:16.167 --> 00:36:17.867
and how to secure your workplace.

561
00:36:17.867 --> 00:36:22.927
